# Baselines & progress

A schedule you never update is a forecast. Once work starts, you want to see two things at once: what was originally agreed, and what's actually happening now. A **baseline** freezes the first; **progress** and the **status date** track the second. This guide shows how to save and manage a baseline, how to make variance visible, how to enter progress, and exactly what the status date does to your schedule.

## What you'll learn here

- Saving and managing a baseline, and which baseline is active.
- Seeing variance: the baseline overlay in the Gantt and the variance report.
- Entering progress — percentage, actual dates — via the panel, the task dialog and the context menu.
- The status date: what it does to not-yet-started tasks and to unmarked milestones.
- The progress mode: Retained Logic or Progress Override.
- Out-of-sequence warnings: what they mean and how to resolve them.
- Reading the progress line.

Follow along with [Nieuwbouw 6 Rijwoningen De Akkers](examples://showcase-rijwoningen-de-akkers.ifc) (one baseline before start, plus progress and a status date partway through the project) and with [Nieuwbouw Appartementencomplex De Vaart](examples://showcase-appartementencomplex.ifc) (two baselines — a contract baseline and a rebaseline after a change order — with their own progress and status date).

## Saving and managing a baseline

Open the **Baselines** window via **Manage baselines…** in the **Baselines & progress** ribbon group on the **Planning** tab. Under **Save new baseline** there is a suggested name ("Baseline 1 — [date]"); change it if you like and click **Save**. The same window lets you review, rename or delete existing baselines.

The window shows a table with every saved baseline: an **Active** radio button, the **Name** (editable directly), the **Created** date, and a delete button. Exactly one baseline can be active at a time — that's the baseline the Gantt overlay and the variance report compare against. Deleting the active baseline asks for confirmation (no baseline stays active afterward until you pick another one or save a new one). If the schedule is out of date since the last calculation, the window shows a hint next to "Save new baseline" to recalculate first — a baseline saved against an out-of-date schedule would freeze the wrong dates.

A baseline is a snapshot: the start, finish and (for milestones) date of every task at the moment you saved it. Change the schedule further afterward and the baseline stays unchanged until you save a new one yourself.

## Seeing variance

### In the Gantt: the baseline overlay

Turn the overlay on via **View → Baselines & progress ribbon group → Baseline overlay**. A thin sub-bar (or a diamond for a milestone) appears under every task bar, in the baseline color, at the original baseline dates. If the main bar runs past its sub-bar, you can see at a glance how far a task has slipped relative to the baseline — without opening a separate report.

### As a report: the variance report

Go to the **Report** tab, choose **Variance** for **Report type**. The report shows, per task: **Baseline start**, **Baseline finish**, **Current start**, **Current finish**, **Δ start (wd)**, **Δ finish (wd)** and a **Status** (**On schedule**, **Later**, **Earlier**, **New** for tasks added since the baseline, or **Dropped** for tasks removed since). At the top the report totals the number of tasks, how many are later and how many earlier, and — if the project end date has shifted — a line with the number of work days' difference relative to the baseline. If there's no active baseline, the report says so explicitly instead of showing an empty table.

## Entering progress

You set progress in three places, all with the same effect:

1. **Properties panel** — the **Progress** section under a selected task: a slider for **percent complete**, and (for a regular task) **Actual start**/**Actual finish** fields, or (for a milestone) a single **Actual date** field. Push the percentage above 0% without an actual start date, and it's filled in automatically with the planned early start; pull it back below 100% and any actual finish you'd entered is cleared again.
2. **Task dialog** — the same **Progress** section, in the **Edit task** window.
3. **Context menu** — right-click a task, **Progress** submenu, with the fixed steps **0%**, **25%**, **50%**, **75%** and **100%**. Handy for a quick update without opening a panel; for an in-between percentage or a specific actual date use the panel or the task dialog.

Actual dates can never be later than the status date — try to enter a later one and the app rejects it with an error. That's a deliberate boundary: a "fact" (something that actually happened) can, by definition, not lie in the future relative to the moment you're recording progress.

**No status date yet?** Progress is measured up to the status date. If you enter progress — a percentage, an actual date, or in the Table view also the status or an actual or remaining duration — while no status date is set, the app sets it to today and tells you so at the bottom of the screen. Feel free to move it to your real data date afterwards. A single **Undo** (Ctrl+Z) reverts the progress and the status date together. An actual date later than today is rejected in that case: it would lie after the new status date. Without a status date the calculation would treat an in-progress task inconsistently (forward with the remaining duration, backward with the full duration), which shows up as false negative float.

**A task that was planned to start later?** If you enter progress on a task without an actual start while its planned start lies after the status date, the app doesn't make up a start date: first the question **Enter the actual start** appears, with the status date as the suggestion. A date after the status date, or after an actual finish you entered, isn't possible — the window says why and **Apply progress** stays disabled. **Cancel** leaves everything as it was; after **Apply progress** the start and the progress are a single step for Ctrl+Z. The same applies at 100%: the actual finish then lands on the status date, or on the finish you entered yourself. If one action touches several tasks at once (the context menu on a selection, pasting in the Table view), each task gets its own date field in the same question. For a milestone the actual date is both start and finish; there's no question there.

**Changing the duration of a task that's already running.** Work that's done stays done. If you change the duration of a started, not yet finished task, the work already done stays the same, the remaining duration becomes *new duration minus work done* and the percentage adjusts — as in MS Project. Example: 10 working days at 40% (4 days done) changed to 12 working days ⇒ 8 days to go, 33%. After recalculating, the finish therefore moves with the new duration. A duration shorter than the work already done isn't possible: the app rejects it with a message (in the Table view as an error at the cell) and keeps the duration. Exactly equal to the work done makes the task complete. If you enter a new percentage in the same edit, for example in **Edit task**, that percentage applies. The same rule applies to changes made through the AI connection.

### Progress of a phase

A phase — a task with tasks below it — has no progress of its own. Its **percent complete** and its **status** are derived from the tasks below it on every calculation (**F5** or **Calculate**). The percentage is weighted by duration: a ten-work-day task counts twice as much as a five-day one. It is exactly the number the **WBS summary** on the **Report** tab shows, and what the Table, the tooltip, the PDF and the AI assistant see. The status follows along: **Completed** once every task below it is done, **In progress** as soon as one has begun, otherwise **Not started**.

The same goes for its **actual dates**. A phase's **Actual start** is the earliest actual start of the tasks below it, as soon as one has begun. Its **Actual finish** is the latest actual finish, but only once every task below it is done: while one is still running, the phase has no actual finish. These derived dates also go into the exports and the IFC file, and the two exceptions below apply to them too.

That's why you can't fill in a phase's progress yourself. In the properties panel and the task dialog, a phase's slider and actual dates are disabled, and in the **Table** the progress columns of a phase row are read-only. Choose **Progress** in the context menu on a phase and every task below it gets that percentage; after the next calculation the phase follows by itself.

Two exceptions follow the same rule as a phase's dates. A manually scheduled phase from an MS Project file (`.mpp`) keeps the progress stored in the file. And while you're viewing the [dates as recorded](docs://datums-zoals-opgeslagen), a phase shows the progress from the file; as soon as you calculate again, it's derived once more.

## The status date

The **status date** (**Baselines & progress** ribbon group on the Planning tab, **Status date** field) marks "today" within the schedule — the moment you recorded progress as of. Once it's set, it does two things at once:

- Any task or milestone that hasn't started yet (0% complete, no actual start) cannot begin earlier than the status date, even if the logic (predecessors, relations) would otherwise allow an earlier start. Its calculated early start gets "floored" to the status date — this is the P6 convention and applies by default. One exception: a project you imported from MS Project (`.mpp`) instead follows MS Project's own convention and does *not* floor unstarted tasks to the status date.
- Tasks that have already started or finished keep their actual dates — those are never overwritten by the status date.

You can see this exactly in the medium-sized showcase: with the status date set to 20 May 2027, several not-yet-started tasks (for example bricklaying and plumbing work on different houses) have their early start pinned exactly on that date, even though they run in different houses and would, without the status-date floor, have started on various, earlier dates.

### Why an unmarked milestone "shifts to the right"

In the calculation a milestone is nothing more than a task with zero duration, so the same rule applies: if it hasn't been marked complete yet (no 100%, no actual date), its calculated date cannot fall before the status date. Keep pushing the status date forward without marking the milestone complete, and its displayed date in the Gantt keeps shifting right along with it, even though nothing has changed about the underlying tasks — the schedule is effectively saying "this moment can't lie in the past if you haven't checked it off yet." Once you do mark the milestone complete with an actual date, it snaps back to that fixed date and stops shifting. (The `.mpp` exception above applies here too: in a project imported from MS Project, an unmarked milestone does not shift along with the status date.)

## The progress mode

Next to the status date, the same ribbon group holds the **Progress mode** drop-down, with two values. It determines where the remaining part of an *in-progress* task (started, not yet complete) begins:

- **Retained Logic** (default) — the remainder starts at the status date (without a status date: at the task's own actual start), but not before the moment its predecessors allow. The relations therefore still apply to the work that is left.
- **Progress Override** — the remainder starts at the status date without waiting for its predecessors: actual progress takes precedence over the relationship logic. In the Primavera P6 calculation profile, the calculation also ignores the relation from a not-yet-complete predecessor to such an in-progress task for float.

The difference only shows on tasks that have started while a predecessor is not yet finished — exactly the cases reported as out-of-sequence (see below). Choosing another mode marks the schedule as out of date; press **F5** (or let *Calculate automatically* do it) to see the effect. The choice belongs to the project, is stored in the IFC file and can be undone with Ctrl+Z; an `.xer` import takes over the P6 project's setting.

## Out-of-sequence warnings

Once there's a status date, the calculation also checks whether the recorded facts (actual start/finish dates) don't contradict the logic of the relations — for example a successor that has already started while its predecessor, according to the schedule, shouldn't have finished yet. Such cases are called **out-of-sequence** and show up as a warning in the status bar at the bottom of the screen ("N out-of-sequence relation(s)"), with a tooltip for the count. It's a warning, not a blocking error — the calculation carries on regardless.

Resolve an out-of-sequence warning by recording the actual situation accurately: fill in the missing or incorrect actual start/finish date on the tasks involved (via the panel, the task dialog or the context menu, as above), so the recorded facts line up again with what logically must have preceded them. Often this simply means: a task that in reality has already finished wasn't yet marked as such in the schedule.

## The progress line

Turn the progress line on via **View → Baselines & progress ribbon group → Progress line**. It draws an orange dashed line (4/4 dashes, same style as the status-date line) that plots, for every task, a point at the position corresponding to its percent complete, and connects that to the status date — the classic zigzag pattern. A kink to the left of the status date means a task is behind what you'd expect based on elapsed time; a kink to the right means it's ahead. The progress line already draws the status-date vertical itself as the spine of the zigzag, so the separate **Status date line** toggle (same ribbon group) recedes while the progress line is on — it only becomes visible again once you turn the progress line off and still want the status date shown as a plain vertical line.
