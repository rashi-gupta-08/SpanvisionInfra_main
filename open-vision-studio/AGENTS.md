# AGENTS.md

Compact guide for AI agents working in this repo. The canonical deep-dive is
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) plus the per-area files in `.claude/rules/` — read them before non-trivial work. This file captures
only what an agent would otherwise get wrong.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Dev launcher (scripts/dev-server.mjs) — per-worktree fixed port (3007-3106), refuses double start
npm run build        # tsc && vite build → dist/  ← main static check (tsconfig has noEmit: true)
npm run tauri:dev    # desktop app via scripts/tauri-dev.mjs — same per-worktree fixed port as `dev`
                      # (scripts/dev-port.mjs, lane 3007-3106), stamped in .claude/launch.json
npm run tauri:build  # desktop installers
npm run bump X.Y.Z   # CalVer sync (package.json + tauri.conf.json + lock; Cargo.toml stays 0.1.0)
npm run verify       # THE gate — the same steps CI runs (split in parallel), plus the release and deploy gates
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit over src/ AND scripts/+tests/ (tsconfig.tests.json); incremental, cache in node_modules/.cache/ops-tsc
npm run lint         # eslint src — deliberately minimal, see below
npm run lint:fast    # same lint with a cache, for iterating; can miss type-aware findings in unchanged files, so `lint` stays the gate
npm test             # all five behavioral suites (planning, library, mcp, dev-server, browser)
bash tests/planning/run.sh cases-<x>.json  # one data-driven battery
bash tests/planning/run.sh check-<x>.ts    # one targeted check-*.ts battery
npx playwright install --with-deps --only-shell chromium  # one-time setup for test:browser
```

- **Lint exists — it is just deliberately minimal.** `eslint.config.js`
  enforces only `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises`,
  `@typescript-eslint/no-misused-promises`, `no-control-regex`,
  `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks`, `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`, and an error on
  unused `eslint-disable` suppressions. There is still **no formatter and no
  style rules** — `tsc --strict` (`noUnusedLocals`/`noUnusedParameters`) is
  the main static gate; `import/no-cycle` is deliberately not in the ESLint
  config either, because `verify:cycles` covers it better (post-type-erasure
  graph, no false positives on `import type`).
- **`npm run verify` is one definition, in `package.json`** — the release and
  deploy gates run that line; ci.yml runs the same steps in parallel jobs via
  `scripts/verify-parts.mjs`, which reads them from that definition — so what passes
  locally is exactly what passes in CI. The steps, in this order:
  `typecheck` → `lint` → `test` (all five suites) → `verify:examples` →
  `verify:docs` → `verify:i18n` → `verify:release-highlights-json` →
  `verify:store-boundaries` → `verify:conventions` → `verify:gantt-boundaries` → `verify:cycles` →
  `verify:text-roles`. (`verify:audit` is a separate command, deliberately not in the chain.)
- Five behavioral suites behind `npm test`: `tests/planning/` (data-driven
  CPM/calendar cases + a large set of `check-*.ts` contract batteries plus a
  timezone matrix, headless on Node via esbuild), `tests/library/`, `tests/mcp/`,
  `tests/dev-server/` (`node:test` + an integration script), and
  `tests/browser/` (real Chromium via Playwright — one-time setup:
  `npx playwright install --with-deps --only-shell chromium`). Run the
  planning suite after touching anything in `src/engine/scheduler/`,
  `src/engine/calendar/`, or the `runCPM` action. **Judge every suite by its
  exit code** — intermediate lines such as "alles groen" only cover their own
  part. `tests/planning/` ends with an `EINDOORDEEL planningssuite: GROEN/ROOD`
  line that always matches its exit code, and a new `tests/planning/check-*.ts`
  runs automatically (no wiring in `run.sh` needed).
- Node 22 (see CI). Rust stable required only for `tauri:*` commands.
- New user-visible strings go through `t(...)` in all fourteen locales;
  `npm run verify:i18n` checks that, CLDR plural categories included.

## Architectural facts that bite

- **IFC 4.3 is the native file format, not a sidecar.** Load = parse via
  `src/services/ifc/ifcReader`; save = serialize whole state via `ifcWriter`.
  There is no JSON project format. Any new domain data (tasks, sequences,
  resources, assignments, calendar) must round-trip through the IFC layer or
  it is lost on save/reload. CSV/MS Project/P6 services are import/export
  adapters, not the source of truth.
- **The Gantt is Canvas 2D, not DOM.** Bars, dependencies, timescale and
  hit-testing live imperatively in `src/engine/renderer/` (`GanttRenderer`).
  React only owns surrounding chrome (ribbon, panels, dialogs, status bar).
  Change visual Gantt behavior in the renderer, not in components.
- **One Zustand+Immer store, composed of slices.** `src/state/appStore.ts`
  spreads slice-creators from `src/state/slices/`; each slice is typed
  (`AppSlice<XSlice>`) against the **full** `AppState`, so cross-slice
  actions (runCPM, undo/redo, file I/O) mutate the whole draft. Add new
  state/actions to the matching slice.
- **New project data goes in `DOCUMENT_FIELDS`** (`src/state/documentContract.ts`)
  — one descriptor list stating, per field, where it lives in the live state, its
  fresh default, and its role in the undo snapshot. `capturePayload`/
  `hydratePayload`/`freshPayload` walk that single list, so capture and hydrate
  cannot diverge, and a `DocumentPayload` field missing from the list is a
  **compile error**. `snapshot.ts` derives the undo snapshot from it,
  `src/state/runtime/storeRuntime.ts` owns the mutate ritual (`beginUndoable` →
  mutation → `finishMutation`/`finishUndoable`; `transaction.ts` only re-exports
  it), `ifcSaveInput.ts` picks the
  round-trip fields for an IFC save. Skip this and your field silently dies on
  document switch, undo, crash recovery and save.
- **Scheduling is manual, not reactive.** The actual solve (leaf-filter →
  `CPMSolver`, which owns `CalendarEngine` → write computed fields back) lives
  in `solveProject()` (`src/engine/scheduler/solveProject.ts`) — one
  implementation shared with the resource-occupancy overview. `runCPM`
  (`scheduleSlice.ts`) is a thin wrapper: it calls `solveProject` on the Immer
  draft, then sets `cpmResult`/`resourceLoadResult` and clears
  `scheduleStale`. Store actions do **not** call it themselves — trigger it
  explicitly (F5, ribbon Calculate, menu, after IFC load). Editing tasks without
  `runCPM` leaves the schedule stale (set the flag via `markScheduleStale`, never
  directly). Exception: the opt-in setting **Automatisch berekenen**
  (`ui.autoCalcCPM`, default `false`) lets `src/hooks/useAutoCalcCPM.ts` call
  `runCPM` shortly after `scheduleStale` turns true.
- **Undo/redo is snapshot-based.** Mutating actions capture a before-`Snapshot`
  (`beginUndoable`); the finished mutation lands as an event in
  `historyEvents` — there is no separate redo stack.
- **Multi-document is single-active.** Top-level state is one document;
  `documentSlice` keeps the rest as `DocumentPayload` snapshots and swaps on
  switch/new/close. App-global state (most of `ui`, `taskClipboard`) is not
  swapped — that's how copy/paste works across documents.

## Tauri / web-build guard

```ts
const isTauri = () => '__TAURI_INTERNALS__' in window;
```

- Anything importing `@tauri-apps/*` must be **dynamically imported inside an
  `isTauri()` branch** (or otherwise guarded). Top-level Tauri plugin imports
  break the web build (`dist/` is a real production deploy, not just dev).
  Since v2026.7.11 the browser build does its own file I/O (File System
  Access API on Chromium, download-fallback elsewhere) and auto-save
  recovery (IndexedDB) — only the in-app updater and the MCP bridge
  (`src/services/mcp/server.ts`) are Tauri-only.
- **Rust backend is thin.** File I/O funnels through `src/services/fileAccess/`
  (runtime-dispatched: Tauri `plugin-fs`/`plugin-dialog` vs web File System
  Access API, unified via a `FileRef` model), not `invoke`. The
  `invoke_handler` (`src-tauri/src/main.rs`) exposes exactly three commands:
  `install_kind` (`src/services/updater/updaterService.ts`), and
  `mcp_bridge_start`/`mcp_bridge_stop` (`src/services/mcp/server.ts`, gated
  behind `ui.aiMode` — see *Self-testing* below). When adding file operations,
  extend `fileAccess` — not a Rust command.
- Enabled plugins: fs, dialog, shell, store, os, updater, process,
  clipboard-manager. App id `org.openaec.planner`.

## Conventions

- Path alias **`@/` → `src/`** (in both `vite.config.ts` and `tsconfig.json`).
  Use it consistently.
- **Working language is Dutch** for code comments, commit messages, and the
  canonical source translations. User-facing strings must go through `t(...)`
  (never hard-code) — 14 locales in `src/i18n/`; `ar` and `fa` are RTL.
- **`immer` is pinned EXACTLY (`"11.1.4"`, no caret)** — one of only two exactly
  pinned dependencies (the other is `@playwright/test`). Do not "restore consistency" by putting the `^` back. Immer sits
  directly under undo/redo, snapshot sharing (`src/state/snapshot.ts` deliberately
  shares references instead of cloning) and auto-freeze, so a silent minor bump
  changes the semantics of the state layer. It also breaks the build: from
  **11.1.8** onward `current`/`original` are typed `<T>(value: Draft<T>): T`
  instead of `<T>(value: T)`, and `isDraft()` is not a type guard — see
  `src/state/immerDraft.ts`. `npm ci` was always safe (all four workflows use it),
  but `npm update` would move it: measured `change immer 11.1.4 => 11.1.18` with
  the caret, nothing without. Bumping it is a deliberate, separately reviewed
  change — read the changelog for draft/freeze/structural-sharing behaviour first.
- Settings persist to **`localStorage` under `ops-`-prefixed keys**
  (`src/utils/settingsStore.ts`). The Rust side still registers
  `tauri-plugin-store`, but it is **unused** (no npm package, no JS caller) —
  do not reach for it for settings.
- Project auto-save runs in **both** Tauri and browser: **throttled to 10 s** in
  `src/hooks/useAutoSave.ts` (a throttle, not a debounce — a debounce would only
  write 10 s after the *last* edit and so widen the data-loss window during a long
  editing session), an immutable IFC snapshot generation per *changed* document via
  `src/services/recovery/recoveryStore.ts` (Tauri: `appDataDir`; web:
  IndexedDB), keyed by worktree instance slug.
- **`public/docs/` is a documentation subsystem with its own CI gate** — 38
  articles in `nl` + `en` (26 of them also in the other 12 languages, which
  fall back to English) plus a manifest, feeding the in-app help viewer
  (Backstage → Help) and the generated GitHub wiki (`npm run publish:wiki`;
  never hand-edit the wiki). Articles render through a *limited* Markdown subset
  (`src/utils/miniMarkdown.tsx`): no tables, no blockquotes, no h4, no raw HTML,
  and only `docs://`/`examples://` links. `npm run verify:docs` enforces all of
  that. A user-visible feature needs an article (at minimum `nl` + `en`) or it is
  undiscoverable.

## Worktrees (how concurrent dev instances coexist)

- Worktrees live under `.claude/worktrees/`. `vite.config.ts` explicitly
  ignores that path (anchored to `__dirname`) so a dev server here doesn't
  blow past `fs.inotify.max_user_watches` watching sibling worktrees.
- `scripts/tauri-dev.mjs` uses the same **fixed** per-worktree port assignment
  as `dev` (`scripts/dev-port.mjs`, lane 3007-3106, anchored to the worktree
  root and stamped in `.claude/launch.json`), and derives a slug from the
  worktree directory name; the desktop window's
  `devUrl` and the auto-save recovery filename both follow it. Multiple
  worktrees can run `tauri:dev` at once without clobbering each other. Never
  assume port 3007 — read the actual port from the dev-server's own output or
  from `.claude/launch.json`.
- Call a UI change “working in the app” only after you have verified that the
  active localhost server serves the worktree and commit containing that
  change. If the change lives only in an isolated worktree, state its exact
  localhost URL; never imply that another already-open localhost tab includes
  it.

## Self-testing

- **`.mcp.json`** (repo root) wires up an official Playwright MCP server
  (headless Chromium) — the default way an agent drives the browser dev
  build directly (click, type, screenshot).
- **Dev-only hook `window.__OPS__`** (installed by `src/utils/devBridge.ts`):
  store (`getState`/`setState`/`subscribe`), the log-bus, `extensions.*`, and
  observer-only Canvas/Gantt geometry. Prefer asserting via store state over
  canvas pixels; it must never perform the tested user action itself.
- The app also exposes its own **MCP bridge** with the `planner_*` tools
  (`src/services/mcp/`) — the real AI-assistant surface, Tauri-only, gated
  behind `ui.aiMode` (see `.claude/rules/mcp.md`).
  Not a dev-only test hook and not a substitute for the two mechanisms above.
- Full detail, including the committed `tests/browser/` regression suite:
  [`docs/self-test-harness.md`](docs/self-test-harness.md).

## Which check after which change

| change | run |
|---|---|
| planning/scheduler code | `bash tests/planning/run.sh` in full before the PR — no argument runs every `cases-*.json` battery, every `check-*.ts` battery and the timezone matrix |
| one CPM/calendar case battery | `bash tests/planning/run.sh cases-<x>.json` — runs only that battery; skips **all** `check-*.ts` batteries and the timezone matrix |
| one targeted check | `bash tests/planning/run.sh check-<x>.ts` — runs only that check; skips **all** `cases-*.json` batteries and the timezone matrix (both argument forms can be combined on one command line) |
| document field / IFC round-trip | `npm run typecheck` + targeted `check-document-contract.ts` / `check-ifc-roundtrip.ts`; run the full planning suite before the PR |
| i18n key | `npm run verify:i18n` |
| UI change | the browser smoke spec `node scripts/run-browser-tests.mjs tests/browser/smoke.spec.ts` (or a targeted spec), plus `window.__OPS__` |
| MCP tool | `bash tests/mcp/run.sh cases-<x>.ts` |
| library code | `bash tests/library/run.sh [check-<x>.ts]` |
| in-app docs/guides | `npm run verify:docs` |
| always, once, before push | `npm run verify` |

Judge every one of these by its **exit code**, never the tail.
