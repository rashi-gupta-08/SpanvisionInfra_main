"""Unit tests for the server/ids_validator.py module.

Tests cover:
- IDS file loading and specification count validation
- Complete IFC-IDS validation workflow
- Failed entity extraction with all required fields
- File not found error handling
- ValidationReport structure and field types
- Timing metrics capture
- IDSValidator class functionality
- Report serialization to JSON
