# Task dialog

The **Edit task** window shows all properties of one task — the same fields and sections as the properties panel on the right, but in a window with an explicit save step.

## Opening

- **Double-click** a task in the Gantt.
- **F2** with a task selected.
- **Right-click** a task → **Edit...**

## Saving and cancelling

- **Save** applies all field changes at once; the button is disabled while the name is empty. **Enter** does the same as Save (except inside a multi-line text box).
- **Cancel**, **Esc**, the close cross or a click outside the window closes without applying the field changes.
- Exception: the **Dependencies**, **Assignments** and **Codes & fields** sections work directly on the schedule (identical to the panel) — changes there take effect immediately, even if you cancel afterwards. The same applies to the **Work rule** field on an existing task: that choice is applied at once, so work and units in the same dialog already calculate with the chosen rule. On a new task the work rule also waits for **Save**.

## Fields

- **Name *** — required; automatically receives focus when the dialog opens.
- **WBS Code** — free entry. With WBS auto-numbering on (Planning → Structure) the field is locked: the app manages the codes.
- **Description** — free text.
- **Type** — the task type (for example Construction); drives the bar colour coding.
- **Calendar** — **Project calendar** or a specific calendar from the library; determines this task's working days.
- **Parent task** — move the task under a different parent, or **- None (root) -**. This field only exists in the dialog; in the panel, restructuring is done by dragging or indent/outdent.

## Notes

A checklist per task: each row has a **done checkbox**, a text box and a remove button; **Add note** creates a new row. Completed rows are struck through. See [Planning & WBS](docs://gids-plannen-wbs).

## Milestone

- **Milestone** — ticking it sets the duration to 0 and shows the diamond instead of a bar. Not possible on a summary task or a task with resource assignments; a notification explains why.
- **Milestone kind** — **Automatic**, **Start milestone** or **Finish milestone**.
- **Mandatory (contractual)** — marks the milestone as contractual.

## Time

- **Start date** — shows the computed early start; a manual change anchors the new date as the planned start. If the task has a predecessor, **Save** also turns that date into a Start no earlier than (SNET) constraint, unless you pick a constraint yourself in the same dialog. If the task already has a different constraint (for example MSO), the new start is not applied and a notification names that constraint.
- The dialog and properties panel use the same **Duration [value] [Days | Hours]** control. Type `2d`, `12h` or the input alias `12u`. A regular calendar with working days, start and end time, and hours per day automatically supplies effective working-time bands; use the per-weekday editor to refine them when needed. Only an empty or invalid calendar blocks hours. See [Calendars & hour planning](docs://gids-kalenders-uren).
- **Work rule** — which number stays fixed when duration, units or work change: **Project default (…)**, **Fixed duration and units**, **Fixed duration and work**, **Fixed work** or **Fixed units**. Below it the dialog states what the effective rule protects (for example "Protected: duration and units (work follows)"), and for a task from MS Project its effort-driven flag. The field only appears when *Show work rules and work* is on (Settings → Planning → Calculation) or the document itself carries work rules, and only on a task without subtasks that is not a milestone, a hammock or a task with duration type *Elapsed time*. On an existing task the choice takes effect immediately (see above). See [Work rules and work](docs://gids-taaktypes).

## Hammock (derived duration)

Only on a task without subtasks that is not a milestone. Ticking it makes the duration derived: the span between the **Start driver** (incoming FS/SS relation) and the **Finish driver** (incoming FF/SF relation), both shown read-only. If a finish driver is missing, the dialog reports that the span falls back to zero length. See [Critical path & advanced analysis](docs://gids-kritiek-pad-analyse).

## Constraint and deadline

- **Constraint** — As soon as possible (ASAP), As late as possible (ALAP), Start no earlier than (SNET), Start no later than (SNLT), Finish no earlier than (FNET), Finish no later than (FNLT), Must start on (MSO) or Must finish on (MFO); with a **Constraint date** where applicable.
- **Mandatory (pin logic)** — MSO/MFO only: hard-pins the date and overrides the relationship logic; a violation becomes negative float upstream.
- **Secondary constraint** — a second bound (SNET/FNET/SNLT/FNLT) with a **Secondary date**; not possible with a hard pin. Forbidden combinations turn red with a reason.
- **Deadline** — a target date outside the calculation; missing it gives a warning, not a shift. See [Relations & constraints](docs://gids-relaties-constraints).

## Progress

- **Progress (%)** — slider 0–100%. If there's no status date yet, **Save** sets it to today; if the task would only start after the status date, the dialog first asks for the actual start (see the guide linked under Remaining).
- **Actual start** / **Actual finish** — recorded facts; for a milestone a single **Actual date** field. Dates after the status date are rejected.
- **Remaining** — read-only, derived from duration × (1 − progress): a day task in work days, an hour task in hours and minutes. See [Baselines & progress](docs://gids-baselines-voortgang).

## CPM Result (read-only)

**Early start/finish**, **Late start/finish**, **Total float**, **Free float**, **Interfering float** (when computed) and **Critical path** (yes/no). Filled after a calculation (F5).

## Dependencies

All relations of this task: direction (→ successor, ← predecessor), the other task, a lightning icon on the **driving relationship**, the relation type (FS/SS/FF/SF), the **lag** (e.g. 2d, 3ed, 50%) and a remove button. Changes take effect immediately.

## Assignments

Per assigned resource: name, **Units/day**, **Curve**, **Move to…** (move the assignment to another task) and remove; at the bottom **Assign resource**. Not possible on milestones or summary tasks. Takes effect immediately. See [Resources, histogram & leveling](docs://gids-resources-histogram).

## Codes & fields

Only visible when the project has activity code types or custom fields: a value picker per code type, a typed input per custom field. Takes effect immediately. Definitions are managed in the structure dialog — see [Codes & fields](docs://ref-codes-velden).
