# Import/export

Open Vision Studio stores a project as IFC by default — no separate project file alongside it. But
sometimes a schedule also needs to live outside the app: in Primavera P6, in Microsoft Project, or as
a flat table for a spreadsheet. This guide explains what the native IFC format really means, what
each export format does and doesn't carry, and where importing/exporting lives in the app.

## What you'll learn here

- What "IFC is the native format" precisely means for opening and saving.
- What does and doesn't come along when exporting to MS Project (MSPDI) and Primavera P6 XML.
- What the CSV export contains — and what is deliberately left out.
- Where to import and export: **Backstage → Export** and **Backstage → Import**.
- How extensions can add extra import formats.

## IFC: the native format

An Open Vision Studio project *is* an IFC 4x3 file (the buildingSMART standard). There is no
separate JSON or project file alongside it: **Save** and **Open** (Backstage, or **Ctrl+S**/**Ctrl+O**)
read and write IFC directly. That means everything you do in the app — tasks, WBS, relations with
constraints, resources and assignments, calendars (both the project calendar and resource
calendars), baselines, progress, notes, activity codes and custom fields, external links between
projects — ends up in the same file and comes back in full the next time you **Open** it. If you run
into a new kind of project data in the app, you can assume it round-trips through IFC; if something
does *not* round-trip, that's called out explicitly below.

IFC is also how this app connects to the rest of the BIM toolkit: the same file can be read by
BIM software for the 4D link (schedule alongside the building model). For that, the app writes text
the way the IFC standard prescribes: accented letters, the euro sign, Chinese characters and emoji are
encoded in the file, so other software displays them correctly. Tasks, resources, calendars and
relations keep the same IFC identity (GlobalId) every time you save, even if the file came from another
package, so a link to them in your BIM model keeps working.

Be careful with older versions of this app, from before this encoding. They show such characters as
codes (for example `\u00e9` or `\X2\00E9\X0\` instead of é), and can lose a note or baseline that
contains a quotation mark or backslash. If you save the file there, that loss is permanent. So update to
the latest version before opening a newly saved file, on a colleague's computer too.

## Exporting to other formats

Open **Backstage → Export** for four formats:

- **CSV (semicolon-separated)** — universal table export. All tasks with dates and durations.
- **MS Project XML** — opens in Microsoft Project. Full WBS structure. Note for tasks with their own
  calendar: MS Project always shows a duration in *project* days (the project's "hours per day"), so a
  7-day task on a 24-hour calendar appears there as 21 days — with the same 7-day elapsed span.
- **Primavera P6 XML** — for Oracle Primavera P6.
- **IFC 4x3** — the buildingSMART standard, the same as the native format (handy as a "save as" to a
  separate file, or to share a copy without touching the rest of your open documents).

Each format has its own limitations: the richer the target format, the more comes along, but none of
the three external formats is a full mirror of IFC.

The calculation profile does not come along to CSV, MS Project XML or P6 XML; see
[Calculation profiles](docs://gids-rekenprofielen).

### CSV

The CSV export contains **only the task table**: WBS code, outline level (1 = top level, so a
spreadsheet or MS Project's CSV import can rebuild the nesting — the WBS code itself is free text),
name, duration (days), start, finish,
predecessors (as a text code on the WBS code, e.g. `2.1FS+3d` — so on re-import those codes must be
unique, otherwise the import reports which relations were ambiguous), task type, status,
completion (%), actual
start/finish, critical (yes/no), total float and description. **Resources, assignments, calendars
and baselines are deliberately left out** — CSV is purely a task table for anyone who wants to view
or edit the schedule in a spreadsheet, not a full-fidelity project exchange. When you **import** a
CSV file back in, baselines therefore stay empty (there was nothing to read them from). Also
disappearing without any warning: the flag that a task is **manually scheduled**, the sub-minute
precision of a **leveling delay**, **task splits**, and **resume/stop** resumption data from a
`.mpp` import — CSV only has room for Start/Finish as plain dates, so that extra information simply
doesn't fit. The raw Start/Finish dates of a manually scheduled task do stay put; only the fact
that they're manual is lost.

Predecessors use the same short notation as the lag field (see the **Relations & constraints**
guide): `+3d` (working days), `+3ed` (calendar days), `+2u` and `+2eu` (working and calendar hours;
`h` is also accepted when opening) and `+50%`. That way a lag in hours comes along too, for instance
from an MS Project file. When you **open** a CSV, a column with `%` in its header (such as
*Completion (%)*) is always a percentage — `1` means 1 %, exactly as in **Update progress from a
spreadsheet**; only a header without `%` may also hold a fraction between 0 and 1. A decimal comma
(`2,5` days, `33,4` %) is read in a CSV that uses `;` as its separator, and in a CSV that uses `,`
when the cell is quoted. A number like `"1,250"` in such a comma file could mean either 1.25 or
1250; where both readings are possible the import doesn't guess: the column gets its default value
instead and the developer console reports the cell.

### MS Project XML (MSPDI)

MSPDI is considerably richer than CSV: resources, assignments (including their loading curve),
calendars and baselines do come along. Still, not everything is expressible in MSPDI. On export the
app warns in the developer console (`console.warn`) whenever something is lost, with the exact
number of affected items:

- **External links** between projects are dropped (the other task's "ghost" reference stays
  in-app only).
- **Soft Start On/Finish On constraints** (soft `MSO`/`MFO`) are degraded to SNET/FNET — MSPDI codes
  2/3 are *hard* (Must), so the soft variant's upper bound is lost. Hard `MSO`/`MFO` export exactly.
- **Secondary constraints** are lost — MSPDI only has one constraint field per task.
- **Hammock tasks** (derived duration) are exported as a plain task with the computed dates — MSPDI
  has no native hammock/LOE type.
- **Task notes** are deliberately **not** exported, even though MSPDI has a `<Notes>` field: our
  notes are a checklist-with-checkboxes form that doesn't translate cleanly to plain text.
- **Manually scheduled tasks** (`.mpp` import) are exported without the native `<Manual>` element — the dates themselves do come along (they're
  already in Start/Finish), only the fact that MS Project would show them as "Manually Scheduled"
  doesn't.
- The **sub-minute precision** of a leveling delay is lost — MSPDI has no native
  `<LevelingDelay>`/`<LevelingDelayFormat>` element for our minute-accurate value.
- **Contoured assignments** now travel natively thanks to the contour engine: the daily
  distribution of every assignment with a contour (from an `.mpp`, MSPDI or P6 import) is written
  as `<TimephasedData>` per working day, with the *Contoured* work contour, and read back in when
  importing an MSPDI file — including the interruptions it contains. Only a **split task without
  contour data** (for example a pause inserted by the leveler) goes without that element: the
  computed dates do come along, the interruption itself doesn't.
- **Resume/stop** (a task resumed outside the ordinary progress logic) has no native
  `<Resume>`/`<Stop>` element.
- The **critical-path definition** (near-critical mode/threshold) and other scheduling options aren't
  natively expressible in MSPDI and are therefore lost — those are only preserved via IFC.

### Primavera P6 XML

The same kind of trade-off as MSPDI, with a few P6-specific quirks:

- **External links** and **hammock tasks** are dropped/simplified the same way as with MSPDI, each
  with a warning.
- **Task notes** are also left out here — P6 XML has no suitable field for them.
- **Percent lag** on a relation (e.g. 40% of the predecessor's duration) is "baked" into a fixed
  number of days, because P6 has no percent-lag concept.
- **Calendar-day lag** (lag in elapsed days rather than working days) is exported as a plain
  hour-based lag — P6 has no separate lag unit per relation.
- **Loading curves** travel schema-natively as P6 resource curves (a `<ResourceCurve>` object with
  21 values that the assignment refers to), including the LATE_PEAK curve with its own shape; a
  custom P6 curve that matches none of the six OPS shapes comes back exactly on import (the app
  calculates with it, even though the curve picker in the UI shows it as "uniform").
- **Working calendar exceptions** (a day that's normally off but explicitly marked as working —
  for example a scheduled Saturday) are dropped — P6 XML has no schema field to mark that per
  date. P6 models a structurally different weekly pattern through a separate work-week setting
  instead of individual dates, so an automatic translation would change the entire weekly pattern
  rather than just the one date — that's deliberately not risked. The app warns (with the count)
  whenever this affects a file.
- **Manually scheduled tasks** (`.mpp` import) go further than with MSPDI: P6 has no concept of
  "manually scheduled" at all, so such a task exports as an ordinary task with computed dates —
  unlike MSPDI, the raw stored dates themselves aren't guaranteed to stick around here.
- The **sub-minute precision** of a leveling delay is lost — not expressible in P6 XML.
- **Contoured assignments** travel natively as a spread on the assignment (P6's own
  `PlannedCurve`/`RemainingCurve`/`ActualCurve` notation, anchored at the task start) and are read
  back on import, including interruptions. Only a **split task without contour data** is exported
  without that spread.
- **Resume/stop** (a task resumed outside the ordinary progress logic) is dropped — not expressible
  in P6 XML.
- Scheduling options (as with MSPDI) are not exported.

These warnings aren't sloppiness — they're a deliberate, explicit choice: a visible warning per
dropped item beats silent data loss. Open, for example, the showcase
[Nieuwbouw 6 Rijwoningen De Akkers](examples://showcase-rijwoningen-de-akkers.ifc) (it has task
notes and a relation with a percent lag) and export to P6 or MS Project XML: the developer console
then shows exactly which items were dropped or simplified, and how many.

## Importing

**File → Open** (or **Backstage → Open**) accepts `.ifc`, `.csv`, `.xml`, `.mpp` and `.xer` files. For an
`.xml` file, the app detects on its own whether it's a Primavera P6 or an MS Project file, based on
the content. As described above: a CSV or Primavera P6 XML import produces a project **without baselines** (there
weren't any in the source), while IFC and MSPDI bring baselines along.

A file from Primavera P6 or MS Project carries the dates that package itself calculated, including
the late dates and the float. A CSV file holds only input and is simply recalculated. If Open Vision Studio's recalculation differs from them, the file opens in the **dates as recorded** view: you first
see what the source package said, with a notification, and only after recalculating our own result.
See [Dates as recorded](docs://datums-zoals-opgeslagen).

A `.xer` file is Primavera P6's own exchange format. The app reads it directly but does not write
`.xer` back: after editing, save as IFC. One XER can contain several current projects and baseline
projects; current projects open as separate documents and matching baselines remain attached to
their project. See [Opening Primavera P6 (.xer)](docs://gids-xer-import) for project selection,
text encoding, P6 number notation and retained source data.

A `.mpp` file (Microsoft Project's native format, Project 2010 through 2021) is a separate path:
that import is **read-only** — there is no `.mpp` export, so exporting back to MS Project runs
through MSPDI XML. See the guide [Opening MS Project (.mpp)](docs://gids-msproject-import) for
what comes along and what the limitations are.

A small, technical note for anyone importing a task with an **elapsed duration** (24/7 scheduling,
ignoring days off) from a source that only provides a **date** without a time of day — CSV,
Primavera P6, an IFC date field, or the AI assistant — where that task lands on an **hour-based
calendar**: such a task then starts at midnight (00:00) on the given date, not at the day's first
work instant. This is deliberate: an explicitly read time is never moved to a different calendar
day. This doesn't come up with `.mpp` import, since that format always supplies a full time of day.

## Extension importers

Beyond the fixed formats above, installed extensions can add their own importers — for example for a
format that isn't supported by default. Those show up under **Backstage → Import**, each with its own
name, description and matching file extensions; without any import extensions installed, that
section is empty. Check **Backstage → Extensions** to see what's available.
