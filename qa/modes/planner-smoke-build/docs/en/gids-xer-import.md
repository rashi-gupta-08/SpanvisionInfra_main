# Opening Primavera P6 (.xer)

A `.xer` file is Primavera P6's exchange format. Open Vision Studio can open it directly; no P6 XML conversion or external converter is required. This guide explains what the import does, which data remains available, and where the current P6 model has limits.

## What you'll learn here

- How one XER file can open several project documents.
- How current projects, empty projects and baseline projects are handled.
- Which calendar, resource, progress and metadata information is read.
- How text encoding and P6 number notation are determined safely.
- What happens when the recalculation deviates from the dates Primavera itself had already recorded.
- What saving as IFC means and which P6 features do not yet have their own scheduling model.
- What happens when the retained XER source archive in an IFC file is damaged.

## Opening and documents

Open a `.xer` file through **File → Open** or **Ctrl+O**. One export can contain several P6 projects. Open Vision Studio opens every non-empty current project as a separate document; the document with the most activities becomes active. Empty projects do not create a pointless tab. Each document is named after the P6 project name followed by the P6 Project ID, for example "HarbourPointe Assisted Living (4408)"; a project without a name shows only its ID.

After one file action, one informational notification appears, even when many documents open. It reports the actual projects found and opened, empty projects, baselines and any fallbacks. A later XER file action receives its own notification.

A P6 baseline project is not opened as a separate schedulable document. When it belongs to an open current project, it is retained as that document's baseline. A baseline reference whose target is not present in the file is not invented: it stays out of the baseline collection and is counted in the notification. A self-reference, a cycle of baseline references, or a selection that would otherwise open no document safely reverses the exclusion: those projects then open as ordinary current documents. This prevents a silently empty screen and makes the fallback visible.

Relations between two different P6 projects are retained as external source links. The app does not schedule them as ordinary relations, because every opened document is an independent schedule.

A `.xer` file opens with the calculation profile **Primavera P6**; see [Calculation profiles](docs://gids-rekenprofielen).

## What comes from P6

The import reads, among other things:

- **Projects, WBS, activities and milestones**, including P6 activity and duration types.
- **Relations, lags, constraints, progress and actuals**, plus P6 suspend/resume dates where the source file contains them.
- **Project and resource calendars**, working times and exceptions. Hours and clock times remain properties of the calendar rather than a project-wide guess.
- **Resources, rates and assignments**.
- **Activity codes, UDFs and notes**, including their source structure and activity links.

One calendar rule deserves a separate mention. Some P6 exports clamp a contiguous non-working block onto the Monday–Friday axis: a non-working Saturday then appears as a duplicate record on the Friday before, a non-working Sunday on the Monday after. When the reader sees that pattern on a calendar that does work on Saturday or Sunday, it makes that weekend day non-working after all. Such a reconstructed day is not a record in the file; it is named "Calendar exception (weekend reconstruction)" in the calendar and counts towards the calendar findings in the opening notification, so you can always see that the app derived something here. The rule was derived from a single file and only fires on a multi-day block with evidence on the record itself; on an ordinary Monday–Friday calendar nothing changes.

The P6 option **compute total float against the project finish** comes along as well. If the project has a *Must Finish By* date, that becomes the project finish in Project info and the app calculates the late dates and float back from that date. If the option is on but the date is missing, the app does what Primavera does in that case: it calculates back from the actual end of the network, the latest early finish. The project finish in Project info then stays empty; the app no longer fills it in itself with the latest planned finish from the file. Previously it did, and after an edit almost every activity then got negative float. If you enter a project finish yourself, the app calculates from that date.

The raw P6 source data that Open Vision Studio reads remains part of the document. It survives tab switching, undo, recovery and saving. That is different from claiming that every P6 feature already has an equivalent editing or scheduling model: when such a model is missing, source data is retained rather than silently discarded.

## Completed activities get real float

Open Vision Studio can give a completed activity from a `.xer` file a late side as if it were a task with zero remaining work on the data date. As a result such an activity shows real total float instead of always zero, and it exerts backward pressure on its own predecessors like any other task. Your data does not change: the actual start and finish dates stay exactly as the file recorded them.

This rule depends on the calculation profile, not on the file format. A `.xer` file turns on the project option **Completed task: late dates from the data date**, but that option only works together with the convention **Completed task in the data-date window**, which is off in the built-in Primavera P6 profile. Under that profile nothing changes; turn the convention on in a custom profile and the rule applies. See [Calculation profiles](docs://gids-rekenprofielen).

Be aware of what this rule is and is not. It is **derived from corpus material**: it explains the stored dates of a single (P3) file, but it is **not confirmed by Primavera documentation**. The only direct test case scheduled in P6 itself actually contradicts the rule as soon as it would apply there; that it does not fire there is due to the strict conditions below, not because it is correct there. Treat it as an approximation that follows the stored dates of a single (P3) file more closely, not as a reproduced P6 mechanism. To see what Primavera itself recorded, use the **dates as recorded** view (below).

Even with the convention on, the rule is only active under exactly these source conditions: activities of the "fixed duration and units" type with duration-based percent complete, a recorded planned window, and a project that links remaining work to the plan. If the file also declares that it was scheduled with *progress override* rather than *retained logic*, the previous behaviour stays. Projects from IFC, MS Project or Primavera P6 XML are unaffected.

## Start-to-start lag from an in-progress activity

P6 has the setting *Calculate Start-to-Start lag from* with two choices: *Early Start* and *Actual Start*. Both count only the part of the lag of a start-to-start relationship from an already started activity that has not yet elapsed at the data date. With *Early Start* (the P6 default) the successor starts after the start of the predecessor's remaining work plus that remaining lag; with *Actual Start* after the data date plus that remaining lag. Open Vision Studio reads that choice from the `.xer` file and shows it in **File → Project info → Calculation profile and options** as **Calculate SS lag from an in-progress predecessor from**. Every test file scheduled by P6 uses *Early Start*; the *Actual Start* variant follows the P6 documentation but has not been checked against a P6 calculation. See also [Calculation profiles](docs://gids-rekenprofielen).

## Text encoding and numbers

XER does not reliably declare its text encoding in the file. A UTF BOM is followed; without one, the reader uses valid UTF-8 and otherwise falls back to Windows-1252. If that non-ASCII choice is needed, the opening notification states the encoding used. The app does not guess individual rows or describe them as "skipped".

P6 can store decimal and thousands separators in the `CURRTYPE` table, either as literal characters or symbolic tokens such as `ds_Period` and `dg_Comma`. That notation is read before durations, work and float are converted. If `CURRTYPE` is absent, a dot is the safe default. If a value looks like a comma decimal while this source information is absent, import stops with a specific error instead of opening a potentially wrong schedule.

## Dates as Primavera recorded them

Open Vision Studio always recalculates an opened schedule itself — a `.xer` file included. On most
files that recalculation matches exactly what Primavera itself had recorded. When differences remain,
the app automatically switches itself into the **dates as recorded** view as soon as it opens: you
then see Primavera's own result on screen, not our recalculation. That is a different order than for
other formats — there, the app only offers this view through a button; for a `.xer` file with residual
differences it turns on immediately, because the file brings along a trustworthy calculation of its
own rather than just dates without any scheduling logic.

The same single notification as above appears on open, extended with the number of activities whose
dates a recalculation would shift. Tasks inside this view are recognisable in the table — column
**Recorded-dates source** — and in the properties panel of the selected task. If the late start, late
finish, total float or free float is missing for a task in the source file, the relevant column shows
"Not recorded" instead of an invented number.

Editing a task, or pressing **F5**, leaves this view and recalculates as usual — exactly as with any
other format. The recalculation itself never uses Primavera's recorded dates as input: they travel
along as separate, read-only source data and are used only to show what the file said, never to drive
what the app calculates. Saving as IFC stores Primavera's recorded dates in
the project file — including which axes the source file left unrecorded. Opening that IFC file again
only switches this view back on by itself as long as you have not edited the project since the
import (recalculating and saving do not count as editing). Once you have edited, you get the notice
with a **Show recorded dates** button and decide for yourself. That way a schedule you have changed
in the meantime can never come back on screen with the old dates unasked.

See [Dates as recorded](docs://datums-zoals-opgeslagen) for the full explanation of this view,
including what you do and don't see while it is active and how to leave it manually.

## Saving and exchange

An XER import is an **import**, not an XER editor or XER exporter. When you save afterwards, Open Vision Studio writes an IFC file. IFC is the app's native project file and retains the XER source data alongside the data the app uses. The original `.xer` file is never silently overwritten.

That retained source data has a cost with large files. The complete original `.xer` file travels along in the project file and in every crash-recovery snapshot, without an upper bound. Measured on the largest test file (a 17.7 MB `.xer` with over 2,000 activities): the IFC project file becomes about 50 MB, saving takes tens of seconds, and crash recovery rewrites that file every ten seconds while you edit. With an export containing many projects this multiplies: every opened document carries its own copy. For most schedules you will not notice; if you work with an export of tens of megabytes, expect slow saves and a large project folder.

For exchange with Primavera, use the existing **Primavera P6 XML** export. It is a different format with its own limits; see [Import/export](docs://gids-import-export). Keep the IFC file as well when you want to reopen an edited project later.

### When the source archive is unusable

The retained XER source archive in the IFC file is checked every time you open it: the checksum of the bytes, the schema version, completeness and structure. If something is wrong, the project still opens, but **without** the source archive. You get one notification with the reason. This happens, for example, when:

- another IFC program saved the file and dropped the large archive values or reordered the properties;
- the file was truncated or damaged along the way, so the checksum no longer matches;
- the archive was written by a newer or different version that this version does not know.

What stays: the complete schedule from the IFC. Tasks, relationships, calendars, resources, progress, baselines, the calculation profile (including your own deviations) and the scheduling options are all stored in the IFC itself and load and calculate as usual. The project therefore calculates with the same profile as before it was saved.

What is missing: everything that comes from the archive itself. That is the **dates as recorded** view (the dates Primavera calculated itself), the source provenance for the AI assistant and the source route for extensions. The AI assistant and extensions do not see "no XER source", but that there was an archive that turned out unusable when the file was opened, with the reason.

What you can do: open the original `.xer` file again. That gives you a new document with its source archive. Edits you already made in the IFC are not in that new document. Note: if you save the IFC without the archive, Open Vision Studio writes the file without it. The damaged archive is not written back, and the notification no longer appears the next time you open the file.

## Limits that stay visible

Some P6 concepts are already retained but do not yet have a fully equivalent scheduling model:

- **`TT_Rsrc`** (resource-dependent activity) and **`TT_WBS`** are retained as P6 source types. The solver does not yet have a separate P6 scheduling mode for these types.
- A P6 resource curve with 21 points is retained as source distribution. A recognisable shape can be mapped to the nearest built-in curve for the histogram, but the original 21-point shape is not yet recalculated after an edit.
- **Leveling settings** from P6 (preserving scheduled dates, which resources, the priority list) are read and kept in the project file, but not yet applied: the app does not level automatically when calculating.
- The existing **P6 XML** reader and this XER reader do not yet cover the same full field set. XER can therefore contain data that P6 XML in the app does not yet read or write.

These limits do not remove source data from the IFC project file. When XER-specific source data is present and you export to CSV, MS Project XML or Primavera P6 XML, that source information cannot fit completely in the target format. After a successful export, one informational notification appears with a link to this guide. If you cancel the export or saving fails, that notification does not appear. Exporting to IFC retains the XER source data; the other exports include only the data their own format supports. The original `.xer` file is not overwritten.
