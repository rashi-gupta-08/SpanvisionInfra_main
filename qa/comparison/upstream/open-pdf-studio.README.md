Open PDF Studio is a lightweight, native desktop application that provides professional-grade PDF annotation, markup, and editing tools without subscriptions, telemetry, or bloatware. Built with [Tauri 2](https://tauri.app/) and web technologies, it delivers a fast, modern experience with a Microsoft Office-style ribbon interface.

It is built for people who work with drawings: import DWG and DXF as a vector PDF with layers and a measuring scale, measure and take off quantities, export a page back to CAD, verify digital signatures, make scans searchable with OCR, and let an AI assistant operate the app through a local connection.

## Features

### Annotations & Markup (20+ Tools)
- **Text markup:** Highlight, underline, strikethrough
- **Shapes:** Rectangle, ellipse, polygon, cloud, cloud polyline, line, arrow, polyline
- **Hatch fill patterns:** Cross-hatch, diagonal, dots, and more for shape fills
- **Freehand drawing:** Pen tool with configurable color, width, and opacity
- **Text annotations:** Text box, callout with leader line, sticky notes with popup editing
- **Stamps:** 10 built-in stamps (Approved, Rejected, Draft, Confidential, Final, etc.)
- **Images:** Insert from file, paste from clipboard, or drag-and-drop, with non-destructive cropping
- **Signatures:** Draw multi-stroke signatures, save up to 5 for quick reuse
- **Redaction:** Mark areas and apply to permanently remove content

### Measurement Tools
- Distance, area, and perimeter measurement
- Scale calibration dialog with mm, cm, m, inches, feet, and points
- Per-line scale override, with fallback to the document scale
- Quick scale: right-click a dimension line and type a value (e.g. "12.3m") to recalibrate
- Draggable dimension text and endpoints with live recalculation
- Object snapping to endpoints, midpoints, centers, and edges
- Angle snapping with configurable increments

### CAD Drawings (DWG & DXF)
- **Import** a DWG or DXF through File > Import, Open, or drag and drop
- Choose layers, model space or a layout with viewports, area, scale, paper, orientation, margins and placement
- Appearance: colours as in the file, all black, greyscale, black and white or a single colour; lineweights from the file, a colour table or a fixed width; linetypes, hatch patterns, dimensions, attributes and points
- External references and images are loaded from the drawing's folder or from search paths you pick
- A live preview renders with the real converter, so what you see is what you get
- The result is a **vector PDF**: CAD layers become PDF layers and every viewport carries its own measuring scale, so measuring is correct right away
- Target: a new document, a new page, or an **underlay** on the current page — as vector or image, to scale, below the existing content
- **Export** a page back to DXF or DWG with the PDF layers as CAD layers, at real size according to the measuring scale, with your markups on their own layers, and optionally in the drawing's original model coordinates

### AI Connection (MCP)
- One switch in Settings > General exposes the app to a local AI assistant over MCP — no start-up flags, local clients only
- Over fifty tools: open and save documents, navigate, create and edit annotations, set the measuring scale, take off quantities and place schedules, import and export CAD, print to a PDF file, and more
- `open-pdf-studio.mcpb` installs the connection in Claude Desktop with a double click
- An assistant panel inside the app offers ready-made skills: translate, summarise, draw an element, and detect doors

### Text Recognition (OCR)
- Make scanned pages searchable and selectable with an invisible text layer
- Current page or the whole document, with automatic language detection or a chosen language
- Desktop only; the Android build ships without OCR

### Digital Signatures
- A bar above the page shows, per signature, whether it is valid, whether the certificate is trusted, and whether the document changed after signing
- A detail dialog shows the certificate chain and the timestamp, and "show the signed version" opens the document as it was when signed
- Reads PKCS#12 and validates against the system certificate store

### PDF Compare
- Compare two PDF revisions in a dedicated compare tab, without leaving your workspace
- Side-by-side and overlay view modes with synchronized scrolling, panning, and zoom
- Automatic change detection classifies differences as added, removed, or modified
- Filterable change list with counts; click a change to jump straight to it
- Manual alignment offset (dx, dy, rotation) to line up drawings that shifted between revisions
- Page-pair navigation for multi-page documents

### Symbol Palettes
- Drag-and-drop symbol libraries onto the page for repetitive markup
- Built-in libraries plus NEN 1414 and Dutch (NL) category sets
- Searchable, collapsible categories; enable or disable groups per project
- Create custom symbol groups saved with your preferences
- Dockable to either side of the canvas or floated freely

### Quantities & Object Counting
- Count tool with named tally categories for on-drawing object counting (takeoff)
- Live quantities schedule that aggregates counts, lengths, and areas
- Grouping, sorting, filtering, subtotals, and grand totals
- Configurable columns, formatting, and table appearance
- Place the generated schedule back onto the page as a table

### Screenshot
- Capture full page or a selected region as an image
- Copy to clipboard or save to file

### Crop Margins
- Auto-detect and trim whitespace around page content

### Text Editing
- Edit existing PDF text content inline
- Add new text annotations with font, size, and color control

### Page Management
- Insert blank pages (standard or custom sizes)
- Delete, extract, and replace pages
- **Straighten** a skewed scan by drawing a line along something that should be level
- **Shift page content** by dragging the preview or typing an offset in millimetres, for one page, all pages, or the odd/even pages from a chosen page
- Reorder pages via drag-and-drop thumbnails
- Merge multiple PDFs into one
- Page rotation (90/180/270 degrees)

### Watermarks & Headers/Footers
- Text and image watermarks with opacity, rotation, and position control
- Headers and footers with variables (`{page}`, `{pages}`, `{date}`, `{time}`, `{filename}`)
- Apply to all pages or specific ranges

### Forms
- Fill interactive PDF forms (AcroForms and XFA)
- Create text fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons
- JavaScript validation support

### Printing
- Full print dialog with live preview, showing the sheet, its orientation and the resulting scale ("A3 landscape (420 × 297 mm) | Page: 594 × 420 mm | Scale: 71 %")
- **Save as PDF** at the top of the printer list writes the print as vector with the sheet in the chosen orientation — landscape stays landscape
- Paper and orientation follow the document; large and extended sheets (A1, A0, A3L up to A0L) are supported
- Print to scale (1:1 on the sheet), fit, shrink or a custom percentage, within the printable area
- A page perpendicular to the sheet is turned a quarter so that it fills the sheet
- Page range, subset (odd/even), reverse order, copies, and collation
- Print content: document only, markups only, or both; print as image option
- Virtual printer installation (Windows)

### Export
- Export pages as PNG or JPEG (72, 150, 300, 600 DPI)
- Export as raster PDF
- Export/import annotations as XFDF

### Find & Search
- Text search with match case and whole word options
- Search the **page text, the annotations, or both** (text boxes, callouts, sticky notes, stamp text and measurement labels)
- A result list under the search bar shows the hits per page and jumps to them
- Highlight all matches with result count; navigate results with F3

### Format & Styles
- 12 pre-defined style gallery for quick annotation styling
- Fill color, stroke color, line width, opacity, and border style
- Blend modes for annotation compositing

- Dock to left or right side of the canvas
- Quick access without switching ribbon tabs

### PDF Viewing & Navigation
- High-quality native rendering via a multi-process PDFium worker pool — off the UI thread and crash-isolated, so a bad page never freezes or takes down the app
- Progressive tile rendering for very large CAD drawings: the page and its thumbnails fill in tile-by-tile across the worker pool instead of a seconds-long blank wait
- View modes: single page, continuous scroll, and book (two-page spread, page 1 on the right)

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (stable)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) and a C/C++ toolchain
- System dependencies:
  - **Linux:** `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libappindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev patchelf`
  - **macOS:** Xcode Command Line Tools; universal release builds also need the `aarch64-apple-darwin` and `x86_64-apple-darwin` Rust targets
  - **Windows:** Visual Studio Build Tools with C++ workload

### Build

```bash
cd open-pdf-studio
npm ci
npx tauri build
```

The build automatically downloads the pinned macOS PDFium runtime and verifies
its SHA-256 checksum. Build artifacts are written to the workspace-level
`target/release/bundle/` directory, or `target/universal-apple-darwin/release/bundle/`
for a universal macOS build.

### Development

```bash
cd open-pdf-studio
npm ci
npx tauri dev
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full guidelines.

In short: because the codebase moves quickly, a clear, well-described **issue** is usually more valuable than a code pull request — a precise description can be implemented against the *current* code before a branch would go stale.

### Symbol libraries and content — pull requests very welcome

Content is the exception to "prefer issues over PRs". **We want every symbol library in the world.** Symbol sets, hatch patterns, and other reusable content don't go stale the way code does, so **content pull requests are actively encouraged** — bring the standards and libraries from your country, industry, and discipline. Symbols are organised by industry (e.g. AEC) and country (e.g. NL), and localisation will keep expanding, so libraries for any region are welcome.

### We're looking for a content & extensions maintainer

We are looking for someone to **own and maintain the extensions and the content repository** — curating incoming symbol libraries and content contributions, and keeping the ecosystem organised as it grows. If that sounds like you, please open an issue to introduce yourself.
