# Contributing & building from source

Open Planner Studio is open source under the LGPL-3.0 license and part of the
[OpenAEC-Foundation](https://github.com/OpenAEC-Foundation) family of desktop apps. Contributions are
welcome.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Desktop shell | Tauri 2 (Rust) |
| Frontend | React 19 + TypeScript |
| Rendering | HTML5 Canvas 2D |
| State | Zustand + Immer |
| Styling | TailwindCSS 4 + component CSS |
| i18n | react-i18next (14 languages) |
| Build | Vite 7 |

The Rust shell is deliberately thin: all IFC parsing and serialization, scheduling and rendering live
in TypeScript. IFC 4.3 is the native file format — loading a project parses IFC, saving serializes the
whole app state back to IFC.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (with npm)
- **Rust** plus the [Tauri 2 prerequisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your OS — only
  needed for the desktop build; the browser build needs Node alone.

## Getting started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the browser dev server — it prints which port it picked
npm run dev

# Build the production web bundle
npm run build

# Run the desktop app
npm run tauri:dev

# Build desktop installers
npm run tauri:build
```

There is no single fixed port: `npm run dev` assigns each worktree its own **fixed** port in the
3007-3106 range (anchored to the worktree root, so it survives restarts) and stamps it in
`.claude/launch.json`. Read the port from the dev-server's own output rather than assuming any one
port number — that lets multiple worktrees run `dev`/`tauri:dev` at the same time without clobbering
each other's port.

## Tests

`npm run verify` is the repository gate: it combines strict type checks, linting, all behavioural
suites (including browser flows), examples, documentation, i18n and dependency-cycle checks.
(`npm run verify:audit` is a separate command, deliberately not part of the gate.)
Run it before submitting a change:

```bash
npm run verify
```

Use `npm test` to run only the five behavioural suites. For a focused scheduling change, run
`npm run test:planning`; it covers CPM and calendar scheduling.

## Project layout

See the repository's `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` for a tour of the source tree — the main areas are
`src/components` (React shell), `src/engine` (Canvas renderer and CPM scheduler), `src/services`
(IFC, import/export, print, updater), `src/state` (Zustand store) and `src/i18n` (14 languages).

## Extensions

To extend the app without modifying the core, write an extension — see
[Extensions Authoring](Extensions-Authoring).
