# Build and Deployment

Pile Plane Workspace's browser application is a static Vite build. It needs no
application server, database, or native file-system access.

## Development prerequisites

Use a current Node.js 22 or 24 release (CI uses 22), stable Rust, `wasm-pack`,
and the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` Rust target. The npm build and development
scripts regenerate the browser core; do not edit generated WASM files manually.

Native Rust tests and Tauri builds compile HiGHS and require a C++ toolchain,
CMake on `PATH`, and libclang for bindgen. On Windows, use the MSVC C++ build
tools and set `LIBCLANG_PATH` to the directory containing `libclang.dll` if it
is not discovered automatically. If CMake selects an unavailable Visual Studio
version, set `CMAKE_GENERATOR` to the installed generator, for example
`Visual Studio 17 2022`. These are build-time dependencies; desktop users do not
need to install HiGHS separately.

The Tauri crate is outside the root Rust workspace. From the repository root,
verify both independently:

```powershell
cargo test --workspace
$env:CARGO_TARGET_DIR = Join-Path $PWD 'target'
cargo test --manifest-path apps/pile-plan-studio/src-tauri/Cargo.toml
```

A short target directory helps avoid Windows MSBuild path limits. The repository
root `target` directory works for typical checkouts; use a shorter absolute
path if needed. This override also moves locally built installers beneath that
target directory. CI uses the default Tauri target path shown in the workflow.

## Browser build

From the repository root:

```powershell
cd apps\pile-plan-studio
npm ci
npm run build
```

The deployable files are written to:

```text
apps/pile-plan-studio/dist/
```

Deploy the complete contents of this directory from one commit or release tag.
For the current public alpha source, use release version `0.4.2-alpha`.
This includes the Rust core WASM, HiGHS WASM and Worker assets; the browser solver
does not load its executable code from a CDN.

The [site workflow](../.github/workflows/live.yml) builds and deploys on every
push to `main`, or through manual workflow dispatch. Browser publication is
independent of the Windows release tag and draft publication.

The [OpenAEC product page](https://open-aec.com/open-pile-plan-studio/) is
maintained in the separate `OpenAEC-Foundation/website` repository. Its download
block links directly to a published Windows installer asset, while its release
notes come from that website's generated release data. Publishing an app build
or release does not itself update the product page: let the website data update
and deploy, then verify the displayed version, direct installer link, and release
notes on the live page. If changing shared website CSS or JavaScript with
long-lived caching, version the asset URL in every affected language page; the
download anchor must leave its title visible below the sticky navigation.

## Hosting Requirements

- Serve the application over HTTPS.
- Serve `.wasm` files as `application/wasm`.
- Preserve hashed files below `/assets/`.
- Return `index.html` for unknown application navigation routes.
- Do not cache `index.html` indefinitely; hashed assets may use long-lived
  immutable caching.
- Do not add cross-origin isolation headers unless the hosting platform has been
  tested with file import and download.

## Verification

After deployment, test in current Chrome and Edge:

1. The sample project opens and pile-option analysis completes.
2. Pan, zoom, click selection, Shift+click, and Shift+drag work.
3. A CSV/XLSX project import completes.
4. IFCPP download opens a save prompt and produces a project that can be
   reopened.
5. The WASM request returns successfully with no console or MIME errors.
6. Optimization starts its HiGHS Worker, updates the best-found plan, and
   supports stop-and-use-best and cancel without corrupting the project.

The browser build and Windows desktop build use the same Rust calculation core.

## Signed Windows Alpha Release

Before tagging, update the release version consistently in both Rust crate
manifests, the app `package.json`, the Tauri manifest and `tauri.conf.json`.
Refresh the corresponding Cargo/npm lockfiles and regenerate the WASM package
through `npm run build`. Update the version expectation in `productInfo.test.ts`,
the README badge, release notes, and the release reference in this guide.

Run the Rust and separate Tauri tests above, then `npm test` and `npm run build`
from `apps/pile-plan-studio`. Perform the relevant desktop smoke checks as well,
especially for changes to native file opening, windows, or installer integration.
Merge the verified changes to `main` and confirm the intended commit and a clean
working tree before tagging. Only publish when the user has requested a release.

Push an annotated alpha tag matching `v*-alpha`. Set the version to the prepared
release; never move an already published release tag:

```powershell
$releaseVersion = 'X.Y.Z' # Replace with the prepared application version.
$releaseTag = "v$releaseVersion-alpha"
git tag -a $releaseTag -m "Pile Plane Workspace $releaseTag"
git push origin $releaseTag
```

The release workflow runs the Rust and frontend tests, builds the NSIS Windows
installer, signs it through Azure Artifact Signing, and verifies that Windows
recognizes `Impertio Studio B.V.` as its publisher. A failed build, missing
secret, or invalid signature stops the workflow before release creation.

Successful builds are attached to a draft release. Download the installer and
verify its product version, Authenticode signature/publisher, and SHA-256 hash.
Test installation and launch in a suitable Windows test environment before
publishing that draft as a public prerelease. Signature and version checks do
not replace an installation/launch test; record which checks were performed.

Replace generated notes with the prepared release notes, then publish the draft
(the example assumes GitHub CLI and a notes file containing only this release):

```powershell
gh release edit $releaseTag --notes-file target/release-notes.md --prerelease --draft=false
```

Finally verify the public release page and downloadable signed asset, and check
that the independent site workflow succeeded. The application version is
`X.Y.Z`; the public alpha tag includes the `v` prefix and `-alpha` suffix.

The repository requires access to these OpenAEC GitHub Actions secrets:

- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `AZURE_ENDPOINT`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_ACCOUNT_NAME`
- `AZURE_CERTIFICATE_PROFILE_NAME`
