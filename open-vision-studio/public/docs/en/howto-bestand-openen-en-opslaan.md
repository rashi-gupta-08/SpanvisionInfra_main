# Opening and saving a file

Goal: open a project from a file and keep your changes.

## When you need this

You start the day with yesterday's project, you get a file from a colleague or from another package, or you want to capture an interim state before you change something big. What the app keeps in a file, and why only IFC keeps your whole project, is explained in [Files and formats](docs://uitleg-bestanden).

## Steps

### Opening a file

1. Choose *Home › File › Open*, or *File › Open*, or press Ctrl+O (⌘+O on a Mac). *Open* is also in the bar at the very top. The *File* group is also on the *Table* tab.
2. Choose the file. You open one file at a time. On the desktop and in browsers with file access, such as Chrome and Edge, the window shows a list of file types: *All Supported*, *IFC Files*, *CSV Files*, *XML Files*, *MS Project Files* and *Primavera XER Files*.
3. The project opens in a new tab. If the current tab was still empty and unchanged, the project opens in it.

An IFC file gives its file name to the tab. A project from another format gets its project name.

The app opens `.ifc`, `.csv`, `.xml` (MS Project XML or Primavera P6 XML), `.mpp` and `.xer`. For the last two there are separate steps in [Opening an MS Project file (.mpp)](docs://howto-mpp-openen) and [Opening a Primavera P6 file (.xer)](docs://howto-xer-openen).

### Opening a recent project

Choose *Home › File › Recent* and click a file in the list, or choose *File › Recent*. The list keeps the last ten files that you opened, saved or exported. The desktop app shows the path for each file, a browser only the name.

If the app can no longer read a file in the list, for example because you moved it, it disappears from the list without a message. In browsers without file access, such as Firefox, *Recent* stays empty.

### Opening an example

Choose *File › Examples* and click an example project. It opens in a tab, without a file: *Save* therefore asks where you want to keep it.

### Saving

Choose *Home › File › Save* or *File › Save*, or press Ctrl+S. What happens then depends on your project:

1. If the project already has a file, because you opened an IFC file or saved it before, the app writes to that file. No window appears.
2. If the project has no file yet, the app asks where it should go. It suggests the project name with `.ifc`. After that, that file is the project's file.
3. If your browser only saves through a download (such as Firefox), the file lands in your downloads folder. You see the message *Saved as a download: 'name.ifc' is now in your downloads folder. This environment does not let the app write directly to the location you picked.*

After saving, the *Unsaved* marker disappears: the dot on the tab, the asterisk before the project name at the top and the text *Unsaved* at the bottom right of the status bar.

### Saving under another name

Choose *Home › File › Save As* or *File › Save As*, or press Ctrl+Shift+S. Choose a name and a place (in Firefox the app downloads a new file instead). After that the project works with this new file: the next *Save* writes there. The old file stays as it was the last time you saved.

### Closing a project

Click the cross on the tab, or choose *File › Close project*. If the project has changes that you did not save, the app asks: *Unsaved changes: 'name' has changes that haven't been saved yet.* You choose *Cancel* (the project stays open), *Don't save* (the project closes and your changes are gone) or *Save* (save first, then close). If you close the whole app on the desktop, it asks this for every project with changes. If a project has changes and you close the browser tab or window, the browser asks for confirmation.

## Pitfalls and what the app does then

**An opened IFC file is immediately your project's file.** *Save* overwrites that file, even if it comes from another program. If you want to keep the original, choose *Save As* first.

**Other formats are never overwritten.** A `.csv`, `.xml`, `.mpp` or `.xer` has no file after opening. *Save* writes a new IFC file and leaves the original alone.

**In Firefox every save makes a new file.** The app cannot write into your file there. It downloads a new file each time, with the project name as file name and not the name of the file you opened.

**Chrome and Edge ask for permission.** At the first *Save* of a file you opened, the browser asks whether the app may write to it. If you refuse, the app opens a window in which you choose a new file. In Chrome and Edge you also get that window if writing to the existing file fails, for example because the file disappeared or is locked.

**Saving can fail.** If the saving itself gives an error, the app reports *Failed to save*, with the reason. Your project stays open and is still marked *Unsaved*.
