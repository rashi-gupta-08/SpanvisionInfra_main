# Opening an MS Project file (.mpp)

Goal: open a schedule from Microsoft Project directly in the app, without exporting it first.

## When you need this

A contractor, consultant or client sends you their schedule as an `.mpp` file. You want to view it, calculate it or develop it further. The app reads `.mpp` files from MS Project 2010 up to and including 2021. It only reads: it does not write `.mpp` and never changes your file. From the file it takes the schedule itself: tasks with structure, duration and constraints, relations with lag, calendars, resources, assignments and progress. It also reads the dates and float that MS Project calculated itself, but it uses those only for the view *Dates as recorded*, never as input.

## Steps

1. Choose *Home › File › Open* or press Ctrl+O. Choose the `.mpp` file.
2. The project opens in a new tab, or in the current tab if it was still empty and unchanged. The project has no file: *Save* later writes a new IFC file.
3. Read the message at the bottom: *This project calculates as Microsoft Project. Change it via File → Project info → Calculation profile and options.* The app calculates this project with the calculation rules of MS Project: the calculation profile *Microsoft Project*. With *Open calculation profile* you go to the setting, *Read more* opens the Help about calculation profiles.
4. Check whether there is a bar under the ribbon: *You're viewing the dates as recorded in the file; recalculating would shift 4 tasks.* Then on those tasks the app's outcome differs from the dates that MS Project saved. Below the message from step 3 there is then also a line: *4 tasks show the dates as recorded in the file (not recalculated).* What that means and how you switch to the app's own calculation is in [Dates as recorded](docs://uitleg-datums-zoals-opgeslagen).
5. If it says *This file contains hour-based planning.* with the button *Enable hour planning*, the file contains data in hours. See [Turning on hour planning](docs://howto-urenplanning-aanzetten).

If the file contains tasks with splits, leveling or a resource-driven schedule, another message is added, such as *This MS Project file contains 3 tasks with a split, leveled, or resource-driven schedule. They are imported and shown as such.* For one task the message is in the singular.

## Pitfalls and what the app does then

**Not everything comes along.** The app does not take over baselines, costs and rates, notes and the custom fields of MS Project. A WBS code that you filled in yourself in MS Project is taken over; otherwise the app numbers the tasks according to the structure.

**A file from MS Project 2007 or older.** The app refuses it and reports: *This .mpp file uses an older format (Project 2007 or earlier). In MS Project, export it as XML (File → Save As → XML) and open that file.* Below the message the app adds a technical reason in English.

**A file with a password.** The app reports: *This .mpp file is password-protected. In MS Project, export it as XML (File → Save As → XML) and open that file.* Here too the message comes with a technical reason in English.

**A file that turns out not to be an `.mpp`.** You get *Failed to open file*, with a technical reason.

**The XML route calculates differently.** If you open the MS Project XML export instead of the `.mpp`, the app calculates with the calculation profile *Open Vision Studio* and you do not see the message about *Microsoft Project*. The dates can then come out differently than with the `.mpp` file.

**An edit lets go of MS Project's steering.** If you edit a task whose planning was driven by MS Project's date window, the app reports once per project: *MS Project's date window no longer drives 2 tasks after this edit; the hour distribution itself still applies and stays in the file.* For one task the message is in the singular.

**Saving never overwrites your `.mpp`.** The project has no file. *Save* asks where the new IFC file should go.
