"""
IDS Validator Module

This module validates IFC files against IDS (Information Delivery Specification)
requirements using the ifctester library and returns structured validation results.

The module provides:
- Structured data models for validation results (dataclasses)
- Core validation function to run IDS checks against IFC models
- IDSValidator class for consistent API with other server modules

Usage:
    from server.ids_validator import IDSValidator, validate_ifc_against_ids
    from pathlib import Path

    # Using the function directly
    report = validate_ifc_against_ids(
        ifc_path=Path("model.ifc"),
        ids_path=Path("spec.ids")
    )
    print(f"Pass rate: {report.pass_rate_percent}%")

    # Using the class-based interface
    validator = IDSValidator()
    report = validator.validate(Path("model.ifc"), Path("spec.ids"))

Run as module for testing: python -m server.ids_validator
