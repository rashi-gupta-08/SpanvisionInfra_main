/**
 * One-stop pdfjs-dist init.
 *
 * PDF.js refuses to do anything until `GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc`
 * points at a same-origin worker bundle, so we wire that up once here
 * and re-export the named API surface we actually use from the rest of
 * the app (just `getDocument` for now). Vite's `?url` suffix gives us
 * a hashed asset URL that survives `vite build` and works under the
 * Tauri `tauri://localhost` scheme.
