# Relations & constraints

Tasks that stand on their own don't shift when the schedule changes. Relations record that dependency; constraints record a hard or soft requirement on a date. This guide goes deeper into both than [Quick start](docs://quick-start): when do you pick which relation type, what exactly does a lag/lead do, what does a hard pin mean and when should you specifically *not* use it, and how does a deadline relate to a constraint?

## What you'll learn here

- The four relation types (FS/SS/FF/SF) and when to use each.
- Where a relation can and can't attach — milestones and summary tasks both can; only a relation to your own (grand)parent phase is rejected.
- Lag and lead, including percentage lag and elapsed-time lag (for example for concrete curing).
- Adding relations three ways: dragging, selection, and predecessor/successor cells in the task grid.
- All eight constraint types, plus the hard pin (P6 Mandatory) and the secondary constraint.
- The difference between a deadline and a constraint.

Follow along with the entry-level example [Verbouwing & Aanbouw Eengezinswoning](examples://showcase-verbouwing-eengezinswoning.ifc) (SNET permit, SS overlap, FF link) and, for the deadline conflict, with [Nieuwbouw 6 Rijwoningen De Akkers](examples://showcase-rijwoningen-de-akkers.ifc).

## The four relation types

Every relation has a **Predecessor** and a **Successor**, and one of four types:

- **FS — Finish-Start**: the successor starts only once the predecessor is finished. By far the most common relation in construction: foundation first, then the shell. Use FS when one task physically can't start until the other is done.
- **SS — Start-Start**: both tasks start (roughly) at the same time. Use this when two tasks can run together once the first one gets going — for example wall work and roof structure starting overlapping once the shell is underway, without one waiting for the other to finish.
- **FF — Finish-Finish**: both tasks finish (roughly) at the same time. Useful when two tasks can run independently but must be completed together — for example painting that must finish shortly after tiling, so a room can be handed over in one go.
- **SF — Start-Finish**: the predecessor must start before the successor is allowed to finish. By far the least common type in construction practice — reserve it for edge cases where a finishing task may only stop once another task has started (for example a shift handover).

Want to recognise these first three types in a real example? The "Verbouwing & Aanbouw Eengezinswoning" example contains an FS chain between the main phases, an SS overlap between the wall and roof work, and an FF link between the tiling and painting work.

You can create such a relation between ordinary tasks and between milestones. A milestone normally
has zero duration (if it's been given a duration greater than 0 itself — via an import, for
example — it simply schedules with that duration), but otherwise behaves like any other task: it
can be a predecessor or a successor, and it can sit on the critical path. You can also put a relation directly on a **summary task** — a task
that has subtasks of its own: see the section below ("Relations on summary tasks") for how Open Vision Studio works such a relation through to the underlying tasks.

One kind of link is rejected: a relation between a task and its own **(grand)parent summary task**
(in either direction). Such a relation would effectively tie the task to its own phase — logically
pointless, and without this rejection it could produce a cycle at calculation time that loops back
through the task's own branch, which would make the whole calculation fail. If an opened file already
contains such a relation anyway — for example from Primavera P6 or MS Project, which do allow it —
it's preserved and carried through unchanged on save, but it doesn't count in the calculation: the
task grid's relation-warning column flags it as *not included*.

Such a relation can also appear when you move a task: if you indent a task under its own
predecessor or successor, drag it there, or pick that task as its parent task, the move simply goes
ahead — unless the move would create a cycle (see *Relations on summary tasks*). The existing
relation is kept but no longer counts from then on, and a notification tells you
how many relations that affects. A kept relation like that doesn't block the task grid: you can
still edit the other relations, as well as the type and lag of the kept relation itself.

## Lag and lead

A relation doesn't have to be zero: a **lag** (positive) adds wait time between predecessor and successor, a **lead** (negative, entered as a negative number) lets the successor start earlier — a deliberate overlap. The lag field (**Lag**, in the properties panel and in the predecessor/successor cell editor) accepts a short notation:

- `2d` — 2 work days of lag (the default unit: days on the project calendar).
- `3ed` — 3 **elapsed** days: calendar days that also run through weekends or holidays. This is the unit you want for, for example, **concrete curing**: concrete keeps curing on Saturday and Sunday too, so a lag of "3 work days" would underestimate the curing time if a weekend falls in between. In that case, set the lag to the elapsed unit.
- `50%` — a percentage lag: 50% of the predecessor's duration, recalculated on every CPM run as the predecessor's duration changes (the same logic as MS Project). Useful when the wait time naturally scales with the size of the preceding task.
- `-25e%` — a negative, percentage elapsed-time lag: a lead of 25% of the predecessor's duration, in elapsed days.

A negative number (lead) means the successor starts while the predecessor is still running — for example tiling that already starts during the last days of plastering in the same room.

## Adding relations

There are four ways to create a relation, depending on where you're already working:

1. **Dragging in the Gantt chart**: hold **Shift** and drag from the predecessor's bar to the successor's bar. As soon as you release, an FS relation with lag 0 is created immediately, and the **Relation type** window appears right away — there you can adjust the type (FS/SS/FF/SF) and the lag without having to open the properties panel.
2. **Selection + button**: select the predecessor first, hold Ctrl/Cmd and select the successor next (in that order). With exactly two tasks selected this way, choose **Relation → Link selected tasks** on the **Start**, **Planning**, or **Table** ribbon tab. This immediately creates an FS relation with lag 0. Open its token in the task grid afterwards if you need another type or lag.
3. **Directly in the task grid**: add the **Predecessors** or **Successors** column via the plus button. Open a cell to search by WBS/task name and set FS/SS/FF/SF plus lag. Existing relation tokens can be opened to edit or remove them; related free float, driving state, and warnings are available as separate columns. Predecessors and successors each have their own color in these columns; a driving relation gets a stronger tint of that same color, plus bold.

4. **In the properties panel**: the **Dependencies** section has an **Add relation** button. It opens a draft row inside the same list — no separate window. First pick the direction (**Predecessor** or **Successor**, seen from the selected task), then type part of the WBS code or task name in the search field and pick a task with the mouse or with the arrow keys plus **Enter**. Set the type and the lag, then confirm with the check mark (or press **Enter** again). **Esc** discards the draft row without changing anything. If the relation is refused — because it already exists, for instance, because both endpoints sit in the same parent-child chain, or because it would close a cycle — a notification explains why and the draft row stays open so you can correct your choice.

Whichever way you choose: a relation that would close a **cycle** is not created. That is the case when the successor already comes before the predecessor through other relations, even when that path runs through a task inside a summary task. Such a cycle would make the whole calculation fail. When you drag, use the button, or use the properties panel, the notification names the tasks in the cycle, so you can see which existing relation to reverse or remove first.

The **Driving** column shows, after a calculation, which relation actually determines the successor's start or finish date — for a task with multiple predecessors, that isn't necessarily the relation you created most recently, but the one with the latest (driving) date.

## Relations on summary tasks

You can also put a relation directly on a summary task (a phase or WBS group) instead of on one of the underlying tasks. Open Vision Studio automatically works this relation through to the underlying tasks — the same approach as MS Project:

- **Summary as predecessor**: every underlying task itself becomes a predecessor of the successor. The successor effectively waits for the entire phase — the last task in that phase to finish determines the date.
- **Summary as successor**: every underlying task itself becomes a successor of the predecessor. Every task in the phase waits for that same predecessor.
- **Summary on both sides**: every task on one side gets a relation with every task on the other side.

This is exact for **FS and FF** with a summary as predecessor, and for **FS and SS** with a summary as successor. For **SS/SF** with a summary as predecessor and **FF/SF** with a summary as successor — rare combinations in construction practice — Open Vision Studio deliberately plans on the safe side: possibly a bit later than strictly necessary, never earlier.

Because such a relation applies to every task in the phase, **moving** a task also changes which relations apply. If you indent a task under a phase, drag it into one, or pick the phase as the parent task in **Edit task**, the phase's relations apply to that task from then on. If that would create a **cycle** — for example: Earthworks → Inspection and Inspection → Foundation, and you move Foundation under Earthworks; Earthworks → Inspection then also applies to Foundation — the move is not carried out, because such a cycle makes the whole calculation fail. The same goes for outdenting, when a relation between the task and its phase that didn't count so far starts counting again and closes a cycle.

A notification then names the tasks in the cycle, and nothing changes: not even an Undo step. If you move several tasks at once (indenting them together, or dragging a block), the whole action is cancelled, including for the tasks that would have been fine on their own. In **Edit task** the window stays open so you can choose a different parent task; the rest of your changes hasn't been saved yet. If you do want the task there, first remove or reverse the relation that closes the cycle. A cycle that was already in a file you opened doesn't block a move that adds nothing to it.

## Jumping to a linked task

In the properties panel, every dependency row shows the WBS number of the linked task as a
clickable button. Hover over it to see the same details as hovering over a
task bar in the Gantt chart (name, WBS, duration, start/finish, status, critical path, total
float). Click it to select that task: the Gantt chart zooms and scrolls to it, automatically
expanding any collapsed parent task that was hiding it.
A gold WBS button is a predecessor of the selected task; a purple button is a successor.
Long WBS numbers are truncated in the row, but remain fully visible in the hover details.

## Constraint types

A constraint imposes a date boundary on a task, independent of its relations. Open Vision Studio has eight types, set via the **Constraint** field in the properties panel:

- **As soon as possible (ASAP)** — no date boundary, the default.
- **As late as possible (ALAP)** — the task shifts as far as possible within its float.
- **Start no earlier than (SNET)** — a lower bound on the start date (for example: don't start before the permit is granted).
- **Start no later than (SNLT)** — an upper bound on the start date.
- **Finish no earlier than (FNET)** — a lower bound on the finish date.
- **Finish no later than (FNLT)** — an upper bound on the finish date.
- **Must start on (MSO)** — a fixed start date.
- **Must finish on (MFO)** — a fixed finish date.

SNET/SNLT/FNET/FNLT are all **soft boundaries**: the CPM calculation takes them into account, but a violation "only" leads to negative float, not a crash or a block. The "Verbouwing & Aanbouw Eengezinswoning" example uses an SNET constraint, for instance, to keep a task from starting before the permit is granted.

**A new start on a task with a predecessor.** The predecessor decides when such a task can begin, so a new start date on its own would do nothing once you recalculate. That is why Open Vision Studio, like MS Project, automatically turns it into a **Start no earlier than (SNET)** constraint: when you type the start in the Table (Start or Scheduled start column), in the properties panel or in **Edit task**, and when you move the bar or drag its left edge in the Gantt chart. A notification tells you what happened. If the date is earlier than the predecessor allows, the predecessor wins; if it is later, the task starts on that date after you recalculate (F5). If the task already had an SNET, only its date moves along. If the task has a different constraint (for example ALAP, MSO or FNLT), that constraint and the predecessor together determine the start and a new start date would change nothing: Open Vision Studio then does not apply it, leaves the constraint in place and names it in a notification. Change that constraint if you want to move the start. A manually scheduled or already started task gets no constraint: there the entered or the actual start already drives the schedule. **Ctrl+Z** undoes the new start and the constraint together.

### The hard pin (P6 Mandatory)

MSO and MFO can additionally be made **hard** via the **Mandatory (pin logic)** checkbox, which only appears for these two types. This is the "P6 Mandatory" constraint from Primavera P6: the bar is fixed on the date, even if its predecessors logically contradict that. When you turn on a hard pin, Open Vision Studio shows a one-time warning: **a hard pin overrides the relationships — the bar is fixed on the date, even before its predecessors. A violation becomes negative float upstream.**

So only use a hard pin when a date genuinely isn't negotiable and stands apart from the schedule's logic — for example a legally fixed handover date that stands regardless of progress. Do **not** use it as a rule of thumb for "I want this task to sit on that date": in that case a soft constraint (SNET/FNLT/etc.) or simply a well-planned chain of relations is almost always the better choice. A hard pin can squeeze the whole network upstream: if the preceding tasks want to run through the pin, negative float appears and propagates through the entire chain before the pinned task — a sign the schedule conflicts, not that the pin solved the problem.

A **manually scheduled** task (that flag arises from a `.mpp` import) wins even over a hard pin: such a task keeps its own stored date regardless, and any constraint set on it at the same time — soft or hard — is ignored. That's not a bug but the same behavior MS Project itself has.

### Secondary constraint

For a non-hard constraint (so not ASAP/ALAP and not a hard MSO/MFO), you can add a **secondary constraint**: a second boundary from the same four soft types (SNET/FNET/SNLT/FNLT), which may not bound the same side as the primary one. That lets you set, for example, both a lower and an upper bound on the start date at the same time. Open Vision Studio validates the combination live and shows an error as soon as the combination is invalid — for example a secondary constraint next to a hard pin, which isn't allowed.

## Deadlines versus constraints

A **deadline** (a separate field, properties panel) looks like a constraint but is deliberately different: it's a soft, informational upper bound on the finish date, shown in the Gantt chart as a downward-arrow marker — green as long as the task is still on time, red once its early finish runs past it. A deadline doesn't force the schedule (unlike an MFO/FNLT constraint, which actively participates in the calculation), but it does count as an upper bound when calculating float: if the schedule naturally doesn't meet the deadline, that produces **negative float** without any constraint being involved.

That's exactly what happens in the [Nieuwbouw 6 Rijwoningen De Akkers](examples://showcase-rijwoningen-de-akkers.ifc) example: it contains a deliberately tight contract deadline that the schedule's natural duration doesn't meet, resulting in visible negative float — a good example to look at if you want to see what a deadline conflict looks like in practice, without anything being "broken": the schedule simply calculates through and shows where it's under strain.

Rule of thumb: use a **deadline** for a target date you want to monitor without forcing the schedule's logic, and use a **constraint** (soft or, exceptionally, hard) when a date genuinely is a boundary the calculation needs to respect.
