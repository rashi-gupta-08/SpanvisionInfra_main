# Keyboard shortcuts & controls

This guide doesn't list keyboard shortcuts — that list already lives in one place, and a copy here
would go stale immediately. Instead, this explains **how to always pull up the current list**, and
which control concepts (context menus, dragging, box-select versus panning, zooming) are worth
understanding on their own.

## What you'll learn here

- How to open the always-current shortcuts overview.
- What each of the four context menus in the Gantt view contains.
- How dragging works: moving a bar versus drawing a relation.
- When a drag on empty canvas pans, and when it box-selects.
- Moving through visible tasks or histogram resources with the arrow keys.
- Zooming, document tabs, presentation mode, split view and mini-map.
- How to restart the tour.

## The always-current overview

Press **Ctrl+/** (or **Cmd+/** on macOS) to open the shortcuts overview — the same window is also
reachable via the **Keyboard Shortcuts** button on the **Settings** ribbon tab (group **Keyboard Shortcuts**). This window is read-only and is
built directly from the app's source code: a new shortcut shows up here automatically, with no
separate list for anyone to keep in sync. That's exactly why this guide doesn't duplicate the list —
a second, hand-maintained list would sooner or later drift from what the app actually does. The
window groups shortcuts by category: File, Edit, Structure, View and Navigation.

## Context menus: four kinds, depending on where you right-click

Right-clicking in the Gantt view gives a different menu depending on where the mouse is:

- **On a task bar** — the full task menu (edit, insert, add subtask/milestone/relation, assign
  calendar, progress, priority, trace path, delete…), plus one extra bar-specific item at the top:
  **Start relation from here**.
- **On a task row without a bar hit** (for example a row with no bar currently visible) — the same
  task menu, but without the bar-specific item.
- **On a group header row** (the row that summarizes a grouped set of tasks) — a small menu to
  collapse/expand that one group, plus **Expand all**/**Collapse all**, which open or close every
  group band at once (including bands nested inside a band).
- **On empty canvas** (no task, no group header) — **New task**, **Add milestone**, **Paste** (if
  there's something on the clipboard), **Reset zoom** and **Fit to project**.

This last menu was verified live: right-clicking an empty spot on the Gantt canvas produces exactly
these five items, in this order.

## Dragging on a task bar

Grabbing and dragging a task bar moves the task (or, when grabbing the edge, changes its duration).
While you drag an **edge**, a small dark pill appears against that edge showing the duration the
task would get — `15d`, for instance, or `6h` for a task planned in hours. It updates live as you
drag, so you see the new duration before you release the mouse button. Moving the whole bar does not
show it: that gesture leaves the duration unchanged. Move a task that has a predecessor (the whole bar, or
its left edge) and the new start becomes a **Start no earlier than (SNET)** constraint, just like typing a
start date; if the task has a different constraint, the start does not move and a notification names that
constraint.
Hold **Shift** while dragging from a bar, and instead you start drawing a **relation** to whichever
task you release on — the same thing as **Start relation from here** in the bar's context menu, but
in one mouse motion.

Click a bar to select just that task. **Ctrl/⌘+click** a bar toggles it into or out of the current
selection instead of replacing it, so you can build up a multi-task selection one bar at a time —
handy right before clicking the **Link** button with exactly two tasks selected, or before dragging a
whole selection of tasks to a new position at once in the task table.

First click in the **task list** or on a **Gantt bar**. Then **↑** selects the previous visible task
and **↓** the next visible task. The selection, properties panel and bar highlight follow straight
away. Collapsed, filtered-out or differently sorted tasks are not visited: you move through exactly
the list currently on screen.

Click the **resource picker** of the histogram (below the task table) to make that surface active. There **↑**
and **↓** follow that same list: **All resources** first, then every project resource. This makes it
quick to compare resource load without repeatedly clicking a name. At either end, the current
selection remains in place. Arrow keys with Ctrl, Alt, Shift or ⌘ keep their existing meaning
elsewhere in the app.

## Panning versus box-select

A drag that starts on empty space does one of two things, and that depends on where you start it and
on your scroll mode (**Settings → Scroll & zoom**):

- **In the task table** (the left-hand column with WBS/name/duration), a drag on empty space is
  **always** a box-select — panning never happens there.
- **In the Gantt canvas itself**: if your scroll mode is set to **Zoom + drag** (map-style panning,
  the default), panning wins — exactly as you'd expect from a map application. On either of the other
  scroll modes (**Position** or **Keys**), that same drag on empty canvas is a box-select, letting you
  select multiple tasks at once by dragging a rectangle around them.

In short: the task table always selects; with the *left* button the canvas only pans in drag
scroll mode and selects otherwise.

Beyond that, one gesture works everywhere, always: dragging with the **middle mouse button**
(the scroll wheel) held down pans the view — in every scroll mode, and regardless of whether you
start on a bar, in the task table or on empty space. Handy when you're on the Position or Keys
mode but want a quick drag anyway.

## Zooming

Besides the zoom buttons on the ribbon, **+**/**=** (or **Ctrl+=**) zooms in and **-** (or
**Ctrl+-**) zooms out. A bare **0** resets zoom to the default; **Ctrl+0** adjusts zoom so the whole
project fits on screen ("fit to project") — the same as the button with that name in the empty-canvas
context menu above. The timeline header adapts as you zoom in further: week numbers appear once
there's room for them, and day names label each column once you're zoomed in close enough to work at
day level. If **Show only working days** (Settings → Appearance → Gantt) is on, the header — and the
bars themselves — skip weekends and holidays entirely instead of just greying them out, so a
5-workday task is exactly 5 columns wide.

The vertical grid thins out along with it. Zoomed in well (roughly two millimetres per day or more)
every day gets a line, with a heavier line on the week boundary. Zoom out and only that week boundary
remains; at year level only the month boundaries do — otherwise the canvas would turn into an even
striped pattern that swallows the bars. Weekend shading and the alternating week bands stay at every
zoom level: they carry the week structure once the lines drop away. If you have set a **status
date**, its date now appears as a small label in the timeline header next to the dashed status-date
line, so it can no longer be confused with the today line.

## Document tabs

If you have several projects open at once (each in its own document tab), **Ctrl+1** through
**Ctrl+9** jump straight to the first through ninth document tab.

## Presentation mode

**F11** toggles presentation mode — a full-screen view without the ribbon and side panels, meant for
showing the schedule without the editing chrome around it. **Esc** exits presentation mode again
(and, on a subsequent press, performs the usual "clear selection").

## Split view and mini-map

Besides the **Presentation** button (presentation mode), the **Presentation** ribbon group on the **View** tab holds two more toggles:

- **Split view** — adds a second timeline next to the Gantt timeline, with its own time window. Both parts show the same rows and scroll vertically together, but each has its own zoom and horizontal position; that way you can, for example, keep the start of the project in view while working further along. The second timeline starts at the same zoom and position as the first, split half-and-half; drag the divider between them to change the split. Clicking **Split view** again closes the second timeline.
- **Mini-map** — shows a narrow strip below the Gantt with a thumbnail of the whole project period and a frame around the part you currently see. Drag the frame or click in the strip to go to that part of the project. With split view on, each timeline gets its own strip. The app remembers whether the mini-map is on.

## Restarting the tour

Want to run the introduction tour again (for example to show someone else the app)? There are two
places to do that: **Start tour** in the Backstage navigation (the row just above Settings), or
**Settings** → **Advanced** tab → **Start tour**. Both start the tour immediately, without showing
the welcome dialog first. On the app's very first launch the welcome dialog itself offers the tour,
with the **Start tour** button.

## Further reading

- Open the shortcuts overview itself with **Ctrl+/** — that's the binding source, not this guide.
- Scroll and zoom behaviour is configured under **Settings → Scroll & zoom**, available in all three
  of the app's fixed settings locations (the gear icon, the Settings ribbon tab, and Backstage →
  Settings).
