# Open Pile Plan Studio Release Notes

## 0.4.2-alpha

This alpha adds an MCP connection to the Windows desktop app. A local AI client
such as ChatGPT Desktop or Claude Desktop can inspect the open project, propose
edits, run optimization, and work with project files through the same Rust
engineering rules used by the interface.

### Added

- Enable a local, token-protected MCP connection in Settings. Reading and
  editing have separate session controls; editing starts disabled.
- Read project settings, load points, CPTs, advice, groups, plans, costs,
  technical assessments, and optimization results through MCP. Compare two
  named plans without changing the active one.
- Apply assignments, locks, manual CPT selections, grouping changes, settings,
  legend styles, project properties, and targeted source corrections. Bulk
  changes use Rust validation and one Undo step.
- Start, monitor, stop, or cancel optimization through MCP. The same time-limit
  preference is available in the app, including an explicit unlimited option.
- Create or refresh a project from converted CSV source data, import an existing
  pile plan, open or save IFCPP projects, and export a chosen plan to CSV/XLSX.
  Native file dialogs require the user's choice for local files.

### Improved and fixed

- Keep foundation advice when only CPT positions or identifiers change and
  equivalent CPTs can be reconciled during source refresh.
- Clarify that the coherence cost allowance is measured against the optimizer's
  cost reference, not the current pile plan.
- Keep MCP work tied to the currently open project revision and reject stale
  operations rather than applying them after the project changes.

### Compatibility and limitations

- MCP is available in the Windows desktop app. The browser app still uses the
  same Rust engineering core but does not expose an MCP listener.
- The MCP address stays local to this computer. Its access token is renewed
  each time the bridge starts and must be updated in the AI client.
- IFCPP project schema remains compatible with supported older projects.
  Engineering results still require professional review.

## 0.4.1-alpha

This alpha makes load-point groups explicit planning and optimization units,
with automatic grouping and project-saved manual overrides. It also improves
viewer alignment and stability across zoom, window resizing, and display scales.

### Added

- Select a whole group by clicking one member, or inspect an individual member
  from the selection list. Group and ungroup selected locations in the selection
  panel or grouping settings, with explanations when an edit is unavailable.
- Show group contours from the View ribbon. The contour follows Gabriel-connected
  group members rather than a convex hull. Conflicting assignments use a red
  contour and warning marker; complete selections use an orange contour.
- Review the number of manual grouping changes in Grouping settings and undo all
  of them. Manual groups and explicit separations are saved with the project and
  participate in undo and redo.

### Improved and fixed

- Use complete, transitive groups as optimization units with one pile
  configuration per group. Block disconnected manual groups and retain valid
  overrides when refreshing load-point source data.
- Preserve the project point at the viewer centre when resizing the window or
  moving it between displays. Render symbols, rings, contours, CPT labels, and
  tip-level regions in one SVG coordinate system, and stabilize grid lines on
  the physical-pixel lattice.
- Keep hover feedback on the pointed-at group member. Inspecting only one member
  shows its orange ring and one gray group contour instead of overlapping
  selection and related-member rings.

### Compatibility and limitations

- IFCPP schema version 5 stores manual grouping changes and group visibility.
  Supported older projects migrate when opened.
- This remains an alpha release; engineering results and assignment conflicts
  require professional review.

## 0.4.0-alpha

This alpha introduces HiGHS optimization in both the browser and Windows app,
with live results and more control over practical pile-plan coherence. It also
makes the inspection panels and pile-option tables easier to customize.

### Added

- Minimize pile-plan costs within configurable tip-level, size and configuration
  limits, or minimize differences between neighboring units within a cost budget.
  The default additional-cost budget is 5%; configuration limits default to unlimited.
- Use Quick improve for a local improvement without waiting for a full spatial
  solve. Feasible current plans and improved starting solutions help warm-start
  the solver.
- Follow the best validated solution live, with its score, lower bound and gap.
  View another pile plan while optimization continues, stop and use the best
  result, or cancel and discard the preview. Completed results belong to the plan.
- Choose specific candidate configurations using a matrix with row and column
  selection, and optionally skip locations that have no valid configuration.
- Inspect load points and CPTs together using the optional split view, with
  compact CPT details and a resizable divider whose position is remembered.
- Show, hide and drag-reorder pile-option columns. Preferences are remembered
  separately for single-location and multiple-location selections.
- Return from input sources to the active pile plan with a close button, keeping
  the current selection and viewport.

### Improved and fixed

- Replace the former greedy optimizer with one optimization panel. Use collapsible
  settings, clearer result quality, named output plans and preserved selections.
- Reject non-positive net design resistance as an unavailable pile option rather
  than accepting negative utilization.
- Improve warning text and link contrast, themed controls, numeric field stepping,
  validation styling and compact panel spacing.
- Refresh application dependencies.

### Compatibility and limitations

- Supported older IFCPP projects continue to open; legacy optimizer settings are
  normalized. New projects and saved optimizer outcomes use the current project format.
- Browser and desktop use the same Rust optimization model, solved by HiGHS.
  Search progress and run time can differ between platforms.
- Quick improvement does not prove global optimality. A solver stopped early or
  at its time limit returns the best validated result available, with its quality
  reported separately from the cost reference.
- This remains an alpha release; engineering results require professional review.

## 0.3.4-alpha

This maintenance alpha simplifies the Rust core and application structure while
preserving the engineering model and project format. It also keeps grouped load
points visually consistent across interface themes.

### Improved

- Split the Rust analysis and optimization implementation into focused feature
  modules, including pile options, CPT selection, source data, optimization,
  and pile-tip-level regions.
- Build and reuse one foundation-advice index per analysis request, and use the
  more precise `PileOptionAnalysisResult` name for the request-scoped result.
- Remove unused legacy and test-only APIs from the core and application,
  including obsolete pile-count handling.
- Organize application state, core clients, domain helpers, viewer layers, and
  side panels into clearer feature folders.
- Keep the related-group selection ring at the same neutral contrast in light
  and dark themes.
- Document the current module boundaries, domain ownership, and viewer colour
  invariants for future maintenance.

### Compatibility

- IFCPP schema version 4 remains current; no project migration is required.
- Browser/WASM and desktop/Tauri continue to use the same Rust engineering
  rules, with unchanged intended calculation outcomes.

## 0.3.3-alpha

This alpha supports millimetre-precise pile-tip levels, consolidates project
interpretation and validation in the Rust core, and updates the built-in pile
cost estimates with a documented CROW basis indexed to the latest definitive
CBS GWW price level available during preparation of this release.

### Added

- Enter, import, store, compare, and optimize pile-tip levels at millimetre
  precision, including projects whose available levels are less than 100 mm
  apart.
- Explain the source, price level, and scope of the built-in pile cost table in
  the Cost Settings panel, with a detailed derivation in the documentation.
- Validate persisted pile cost tables at the project boundary in the Rust core.

### Improved

- Use `Peil t.o.v. NAP` in Dutch and `Reference level` in English for the
  project level from which pile length and cost are calculated. The tooltip
  clarifies its relationship to the foundation and pile cut-off level.
- Centralize IFCPP project normalization, validation, serialization, runtime
  interpretation, and engineering decisions in the Rust core. Browser recovery
  now keeps project content opaque until the core accepts it.
- Remove superseded TypeScript, WebAssembly, and Tauri project-contract logic,
  leaving TypeScript responsible for React state and interface choices.
- Refresh built-in round and square concrete pile cost rates using CROW
  foundation cost ranges and the CBS GWW input price index. Existing projects
  and personal defaults remain unchanged unless the built-in defaults are
  explicitly selected.

### Compatibility

- IFCPP schema version 4 remains current. Existing supported projects continue
  to open and retain their stored pile cost table.
- Pile-tip levels stored by older releases remain valid; new projects may now
  preserve finer increments without rounding them to decimetres.

## 0.3.2-alpha

This alpha makes automatic load-point grouping configurable and visible,
rejects ambiguous coincident load-point positions at project boundaries, and
simplifies the spatial topology used for pile-tip-level regions. It also
improves desktop project opening and Undo/Redo feedback.

### Added

- Enable or disable automatic load-point grouping and set the maximum distance
  between connected group members. These settings are stored in the IFCPP
  project and participate in Undo and Redo.
- Show the other members of a selected group with neutral selection rings and
  explain the number of involved groups and marked locations for both single
  and multiple selections.
- Open associated `.ifcpp` files directly in the desktop app, including files
  opened while Pile Plan Studio is already running.

### Improved

- Reject load-point sources and IFCPP projects containing different locations
  at exactly the same coordinates. Import previews identify every conflicting
  location, and source refreshes leave the current project unchanged when the
  replacement data is invalid.
- Use load-point identifiers directly throughout the Gabriel graph, bounded
  faces, pile-tip-level topology, WebAssembly contract, and viewer geometry.
  The removed geometric-site indirection is no longer needed because
  coincident positions are invalid.
- Keep unavailable Undo and Redo buttons inactive while providing clear
  keyboard-shortcut feedback for Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y, and Ctrl+Shift+Z.

### Compatibility

- IFCPP schema version 4 remains current. Existing supported projects without
  explicit grouping settings use the automatic grouping defaults when opened.
- Manual load-point grouping remains planned for a future release.

## 0.3.1-alpha

This alpha makes legend activation specific to each pile plan and extends the
legend editor for comparing and coordinating multiple plan variants.

### Added

- Store active pile sizes and pile-tip levels separately for every pile plan,
  so switching variants restores the intended legend configuration without
  changing other plans.
- Select one or more pile plans as the assignment scope in the legend editor.
  The editor identifies configurations used outside that scope and explains
  duplicate symbols and colours in the affected plans.
- Encode pile size and pile-tip level with colour at the same time: pile-tip
  level colours fill the connected regions, while pile-size colours and the
  round or square shape from the cost table identify the load-point symbols.
- Pick manual colours directly from the selected colour scheme in addition to
  the native browser colour picker.

### Improved

- Reassign symbols and colours across the active legend items in the selected
  plan scope while preserving inactive items.
- Keep assigned configurations visible with a neutral marker when their legend
  value is inactive, and keep optimizer candidates aligned with the active
  configuration of the relevant pile plan.
- Keep the legend editor compact with collapsible encoding and plan-scope
  controls, equal active and inactive columns, and focused conflict details.

### Compatibility

- IFCPP schema version 4 stores legend activation per pile plan. Projects using
  schema versions 1 through 3 remain supported and are normalized when opened.

## 0.3.0-alpha

This alpha adds connected pile-tip-level regions, makes grouped pile
assignments and greedy optimization consistent, and provides clearer technical
feedback when pile configurations cannot be assigned.

### Added

- Show connected pile-tip-level regions in the plan viewer. Region boundaries
  are derived from the shared spatial topology and are coloured only where all
  boundary load points use the same pile-tip level.
- Treat nearby load points as assignment groups. Manual pile changes, default
  selection, locking, and greedy optimization now apply one common
  configuration to every group member or leave the complete group unchanged.
- Inspect aggregated pile options for multiple selected load points, including
  maximum utilization and the governing load point for each configuration.
- Open a compact list of the CPTs whose bearing-capacity data is missing for a
  configuration and navigate directly to those CPTs.

### Improved

- Distinguish missing bearing-capacity data, insufficient capacity, permanent
  grouped technical conflicts, and configurations excluded only by optimizer
  settings. The properties panel explains these states for single and multiple
  selections without relying on marker tooltips.
- Show every technically unassigned load point as a calm neutral marker while
  retaining the question-mark marker for assignments blocked specifically by
  optimization limits.
- Count unresolved optimization results by both load point and group, without
  treating permanent technical conflicts as optimizer failures.
- Use canonical pile-configuration identities throughout Rust, WebAssembly,
  project persistence, aggregation, grouping, and optimization.
- Keep map selection and status overlays centred on exact marker coordinates
  and below the selectable pile symbol.
- Rename the region control consistently to **Puntniveaugebieden**, give it a
  dedicated map-style icon, and enable the regions by default for the sample,
  new imports, and older projects without an explicit preference.
- Make symbol-size and preferred-utilization slider changes predictable in the
  project history: immediate Undo and Redo work while a slider has focus, and
  one continuous adjustment creates one history entry.

### Notes

- The optimizer remains a deterministic greedy heuristic and does not guarantee
  a global optimum. A future optimization method is tracked separately.
- Explicitly hidden pile-tip-level regions remain hidden when an existing
  project is reopened or its sources are refreshed.

## 0.2.2-alpha

This alpha adds live CPT-selection feasibility feedback, restores coordinate
inspection, and aligns selection behavior between source tables and the plan
viewer.

### Improved

- Preview CPT-selection feasibility while editing: single load-point
  selections show the design resistance for the assigned pile, while
  multi-selections show how often each CPT is governing. Governing CPTs are
  highlighted consistently in the table and viewer.
- Show localized X/Y coordinates consistently for inspected load points and
  CPTs in the properties panel and compact hover inspector, while omitting
  misleading coordinate values for multi-selections.
- Select load points and CPTs directly from their normalized source tables,
  including shared row highlighting, Explorer-style `Ctrl` toggles and
  `Shift` ranges for load points, selection persistence across workspace
  views, and clearing from the source header or with `Escape`.
- Use `Ctrl`+click to toggle individual load points in the plan viewer. Outside
  persistent box-selection mode, `Shift`+drag replaces the selection and
  `Ctrl`+`Shift`+drag adds to it; inside that mode, plain dragging replaces and
  `Ctrl`+drag adds.
- Source tables now measure their virtualized viewport immediately and after
  layout changes, keep pointer-driven selections stable while scrolling, and
  render all visible rows without requiring an initial scroll.
- Keep the ribbon tabs visibly separated from the title bar across interface
  scales.

## 0.2.1-alpha

This alpha makes constrained greedy optimization more predictable and easier
to inspect, adds persistent lasso selection, and completes the Windows
installer branding.

### Added

- Activate persistent box selection from the Plan ribbon. Plain dragging
  replaces the selection, clicking empty space clears it, and `Shift`+drag
  adds to the selection or controls the lasso during load-point lock editing.

### Improved

- Brand the Windows application, installer, and uninstaller with the Pile Plan
  Studio logo.
- Greedy optimization now keeps every enabled-value, utilization, size,
  tip-level, configuration, lock, and whole-plan limit in the shared Rust
  core instead of silently applying a fallback outside the selected
  configurations.
- Partial optimizer results explicitly report and persist load points that
  could not be assigned within the configured limits. The viewer distinguishes
  these outcomes from missing or invalid engineering options with a dedicated
  compact marker.
- Optimization summaries now report assigned, changed, and unassigned load
  points separately in both Dutch and English.

### Notes

- Configuration selection remains a deterministic local greedy heuristic:
  each step maximizes newly covered load points and then minimizes cost. It
  does not guarantee a global optimum; follow-up limitations are tracked in
  issue #31.

## 0.2.0-alpha

This alpha establishes a clearer project and application boundary, adds
inspectable imported sources, and makes pile-cost data reusable without
silently leaking project choices into other projects.

### Added

- Inspect normalized load points, CPTs, and foundation-advice rows directly
  from the project explorer, with combined column filters and sorting.
- Replace one imported source from its viewer while retaining matched pile
  assignments, CPT selections, project settings, and other source data.
- Store language, theme, interface scale, default currency, workspace panel
  layout, and explicit user cost defaults in one versioned user-settings file.
- Show or hide the explorer and properties panel from the View ribbon; both
  panels remain resizable and remember their last useful width.
- Require a pile head level when importing a new project and edit the project
  name, pile head level, and project currency through Project information.
- Add, edit, group, and remove pile-size cost rows. Project-used sizes are
  protected, missing rows are reported, and unrelated saved sizes stay
  available in a collapsed group.
- Save, load, or remove a personal pile-cost default explicitly, or restore the
  built-in catalog. Personal defaults apply automatically only to new imports.

### Improved

- IFCPP schema version 3 stores project currency, pile head level, viewer
  presentation, and currency-neutral costs while retaining migration support
  for schema versions 1 and 2.
- Keep equal X/Y geometry in the plan viewer and anchor the adaptive coordinate
  grid to the project origin, independent of panel dimensions.
- Keep world positions stable while resizing or hiding side panels, including
  across legend wrapping and application-scale changes.
- Use one shared compact interface scale in browser and desktop builds, with
  persistent desktop zoom controls and matching logical percentages.
- Preserve algorithm selection labels while manually refining CPT selections,
  and provide direct actions for restoring the algorithm or nearest CPT.
- Improve themed selects, number inputs, scrollbars, table filters, settings
  panels, and hover states across light and dark themes.
- Project viewer presentation participates in Undo and browser recovery, while
  workspace layout and reusable defaults remain application preferences.
- New-project cost catalogs merge personal, built-in, imported, and
  project-specific rows without dropping unmatched custom sizes.
- Source-table filtering no longer reads released React events during state
  updates.
- Windows release builds no longer open an accompanying terminal window; debug
  builds retain their console for development.
- Windows production builds start from bundled application assets and no longer
  depend on a running local development server.

### Notes

- Currency changes relabel amounts and do not convert numeric values.
- Source tables show interpreted project data rather than raw spreadsheet
  cells and remain read-only in this release.
- Automatic refresh from remembered source paths and imperial units remain out
  of scope.

## 0.1.9-alpha

This alpha adds project-scoped legend personalization and improves the visual
consistency and scaling of both the browser and desktop applications.

### Added

- Personalize pile-size and tip-level appearances through the legend editor.
- Choose whether pile size or tip level controls symbol shape, with the other
  property controlling color.
- Choose from 54 technical symbol and partial-fill combinations, including
  manually assigned colors and symbols.
- Reassign colors using Tableau Extended, Even Hue Spread,
  Colorblind-friendly, Rainbow, Light to dark, or Cool to warm schemes.
- Apply automatic symbol and color assignments to all legend items or only the
  active items while preserving manual overrides until explicitly reassigned.
- Scale the desktop interface from 50% to 150%, with `Ctrl+=`, `Ctrl+-`, and
  `Ctrl+0`, and save projects with `Ctrl+S`.
- Use a dedicated Pile Plan Studio application icon in the browser and Windows
  desktop application.

### Improved

- Legend usage updates immediately when assignments or pile plans change,
  without letting optimization alter project legend settings.
- Triangle partial fills now represent half of the visible inner area, and
  inactive editor items retain legible colors and controls.
- The browser starts with a more compact interface while pointer selection,
  lasso geometry, panel splitters, and modal placement remain coordinate-safe.
- Bundled fonts, themed scrollbars, corrected undo and redo icons, and native
  window controls improve consistency across light, dark, browser, and desktop
  environments.
- About views now show shared Pile Plan Studio product information and the
  build version instead of stale template content.

### Distribution

- This release includes the first signed Windows x64 NSIS installer published
  through the OpenAEC Azure Artifact Signing workflow.
- The browser build and signed desktop installer use the same Rust calculation
  core.

## 0.1.8-alpha

This alpha adds project history and browser recovery, and completes the first
single-plan file workflow for projects that contain multiple pile plans.

### Added

- Undo and redo project changes from the title bar or with standard keyboard
  shortcuts. History covers pile assignments, CPT selections, settings, pile
  plan management, source imports, and other persisted project content.
- Show a short history result near the bottom of the viewer, including the
  affected plan and number of changed assignments where relevant.
- Recover the latest browser project from IndexedDB after an accidental refresh
  or interrupted browser session.
- Resize the project explorer horizontally between compact and expanded widths,
  using the same lightweight drag behavior as the properties panel.

### Improved

- Excel and CSV exports now state that they contain the active pile plan and use
  that pile plan's name as the suggested file name.
- Importing a standard or Legacy pile-plan table now creates and activates a new
  pile plan named after the imported file. Existing plans remain unchanged and
  duplicate names receive a numeric suffix.
- Project pile-cost defaults once again come from the bundled sample data and
  are no longer silently changed across projects by editing one project.
- Activating the Load points or CPTs tab closes an open settings task panel,
  while selecting objects in the viewer keeps that task panel available.

### Notes

- Browser recovery is a convenience safeguard, not a replacement for saving or
  downloading an IFCPP project file.
- Excel and CSV contain one active pile plan. IFCPP remains the format for
  preserving all pile plans and project settings together.
- This release does not publish a Windows installer. The browser build and
  source code contain the 0.1.8-alpha changes.

## 0.1.7-alpha

This alpha adds per-plan load-point locking, a coordinate-based viewer grid,
and a more focused settings workflow.

### Added

- Lock and unlock load points per pile plan. Locked locations remain visible
  but dimmed, cannot be selected during ordinary plan editing, and are ignored
  by greedy optimization.
- Edit locked locations directly in the viewer using click and lasso
  interactions, with Apply, Cancel, and Unlock all controls.
- Show grid lines aligned to actual project coordinates, with adaptive spacing
  and a View-ribbon toggle.

### Improved

- Project, plan, inspection, settings, locking, and optimization actions are
  consolidated into a clearer ribbon layout.
- CPT, cost, and optimization settings open as dedicated task panels while the
  permanent right-panel tabs remain focused on load points and CPT inspection.
- The maximum optimization utilization is entered as a percentage field and
  configuration limits now allow temporary empty editing before validation.
- Pile head level and CPT-selection number fields use the same deferred
  validation on Enter or when leaving the field.
- The feedback dialog accepts every non-empty message and opens issues in the
  Pile Plan Studio repository.

### Notes

- This release does not publish a Windows installer. The browser build and
  source code contain the 0.1.7-alpha changes.

## 0.1.6-alpha

This alpha adds multiple pile plans per project and introduces explicit,
project-wide control over the pile-size and tip-level legend.

### Added

- Store multiple named pile plans in one IFCPP project and switch between them
  from the project explorer.
- Duplicate, rename, and remove pile plans while showing the estimated cost of
  each plan.
- Create a fresh pile plan from the cheapest valid assignments.
- Optionally preserve the current plan as a separate variant when running the
  greedy optimizer.
- Edit enabled pile sizes and tip levels in a dedicated legend editor with
  separate active and inactive groups.
- Quickly activate only the sizes and tip levels used by the current pile plan
  from the legend toolbar.

### Improved

- The legend now distinguishes used, unused, and disabled configurations
  without changing project settings after optimization.
- A used but disabled legend item remains visible with a warning, so existing
  pile assignments never disappear silently.
- Clicking a legend item selects all load points with that property;
  Shift+click combines size and tip filters using the existing union and
  intersection rules.
- Legend usage updates immediately after pile assignment, optimization, or
  switching to another pile plan.
- The legend editor supports Apply and Cancel, bulk activation actions,
  keyboard focus containment, and localized English and Dutch labels.

### Notes

- Enabled legend configurations belong to the project. Pile assignments and
  locked locations belong to each individual pile plan.
- This release does not publish a Windows installer. The browser build and
  source code contain the 0.1.6-alpha changes.

## 0.1.5-alpha

This alpha improves control over the pile-plan viewer and makes dense or
overlapping project data easier to inspect.

### Added

- Adjust viewer symbol size continuously from 10% to 200%.
- Set a preferred utilization range and highlight assignments below or above
  that range with progressively stronger green or red feedback.
- Choose whether ordinary load points or CPTs are drawn in the foreground.
- Configure a separate maximum utilization for greedy optimization.
- Show total project cost and the current zoom level in the status bar.

### Improved

- Viewer zoom now supports levels up to 1000% while preserving sharp vector
  symbols and responsive pan and zoom behavior.
- Selection rings, CPT labels, hover hit areas, and overlap detection now track
  the configured symbol size and exact project coordinates.
- The active object beneath the pointer is always raised above the selected
  foreground layer and can be cycled with Space when objects overlap.
- Hover instructions now describe nearby objects directly and show
  `Shift + Click` as an explicit multi-selection shortcut.
- The preferred-range control now colours only the interval between its two
  handles.
- Space no longer activates focused ribbon, legend, or numeric input controls;
  ordinary text fields retain normal text-entry behavior.

### Notes

- The preferred utilization range is a viewer setting. It does not redefine
  the engineering resistance check used for pile-option status.
- This release does not publish a new Windows installer. The browser build and
  source code contain the 0.1.5-alpha changes.

## 0.1.4-alpha

This alpha expands CPT selection workflows and makes project-source refreshes
safer for projects whose loads or source files change during design.

### Added

- Configure CPT-selection settings for all load points when no load point is
  selected, or apply them only to the current selection.
- Define a monopoly distance: when a CPT lies within this distance, it becomes
  the only automatically selected CPT for that load point.
- Edit manual CPT selections for multiple selected load points at once from the
  CPT panel, including removing CPTs, selecting CPTs in the viewer, and choosing
  only the nearest CPT.
- Choose whether bulk CPT-setting changes may overwrite existing manual CPT
  selections.
- Connect common CPT selections with thin plan lines when all selected load
  points use the same CPT set.
- Refresh one or more imported project sources without creating a new project.

### Improved

- Source refreshes preserve pile assignments, manual CPT selections, local CPT
  settings, and project identity wherever load points and CPTs can still be
  matched reliably.
- Refreshed load points are matched by validated ID first and then by a unique
  coordinate fallback.
- CPT-only refreshes show a non-blocking warning that the corresponding
  foundation advice should also be refreshed.
- Refresh requests accept persisted numeric identifiers consistently in both
  the browser and desktop calculation paths.
- Load points that cannot retain an existing assignment receive the cheapest
  valid default pile without replacing assignments that were matched and
  preserved.

### Notes

- Refreshing CPT coordinates without the matching foundation advice can make
  capacities and pile configurations temporarily unavailable. Refresh both
  sources together when the CPT set changes.
- This release does not publish a new Windows installer. The browser build and
  source code contain the 0.1.4-alpha changes.

## 0.1.3-alpha

This alpha adds pile-plan import and broadens compatibility with historical
Pile Plan Studio and RFEM project data.

### Added

- Import pile assignments from the standard Pile Plan Studio Excel or CSV
  table.
- Import pile assignments from legacy `Vergrendeld.xlsx` workbooks.
- Independently choose whether standard-table imports update pile assignments,
  manual CPT selections, or both.
- Preview matching results, coordinate fallbacks, skipped rows, and conflicts
  before applying an imported pile plan.
- Configure the coordinate matching tolerance, with a default of 1 mm.

### Improved

- Load points are matched by a validated ID first and then by one unique
  coordinate match within tolerance.
- Legacy RFEM names such as `Knoop 1603` are recognised as load-point IDs.
- Historical or duplicate Legacy rows are reconciled safely: a current ID match
  takes precedence, identical rows are deduplicated, and genuine conflicts are
  still skipped with warnings.
- RFEM import falls back to the first worksheet for nodes and the second for
  nodal reactions when direct structural detection is unavailable.
- RFEM reaction imports support both primed and unprimed PZ envelope layouts,
  including `Min PZ'`, `Min PZ`, and `Min` rows.
- The pile-plan import panel follows the existing OpenAEC backstage styling and
  uses the shared import icon alignment.

### Still Planned

- Store multiple pile plans in one project and expose them in the project
  explorer.
- Export one selected pile plan or all project plans as a ZIP archive.
- Edit manual CPT selections for multiple selected load points at once.

## 0.1.2-alpha

This alpha improves project-data exchange and adds an RFEM-oriented import
workflow for load points.

### Added

- Automatic detection and manual selection of import profiles.
- An RFEM Excel import profile that combines node coordinates and reactions
  into load points.
- Inline import previews with source diagnostics before project creation.
- Excel and CSV export of the current pile assignments, including the selected
  CPT identifiers for each load point.

### Improved

- Open, import, and export panels now share the OpenAEC backstage styling.
- Import sources are presented as clear role-based blocks for load points,
  CPTs, and foundation advice.
- The RFEM profile can be selected before choosing a file and is automatically
  restricted to compatible Excel sources.
- Import warnings and profile information are localized consistently.
- Browser-only actions are separated more clearly from desktop file actions.

### Planned Next

- Import pile assignments and CPT selections from the standard Pile Plan
  Studio table and the legacy Excel format.
- Store multiple pile plans in one project, expose them in the project
  explorer, and export one plan or all plans as a ZIP archive.
- Edit the manual CPT selection for multiple selected load points at once.

## 0.1.1-alpha

This alpha focuses on making dense pile plans easier to inspect and improving
the visual clarity of selections and engineering information.

### Added

- A compact hover inspector for load points and CPTs.
- Candidate detection for markers that overlap or lie very close together.
- Spacebar cycling between multiple markers beneath the pointer before
  selection.
- Compact marker previews that preserve pile, CPT, missing-option, and
  selection styling.

### Improved

- Viewer coordinates retain their full precision instead of being rounded for
  marker positioning.
- Overlapping marker selection now prioritizes the candidate nearest to the
  pointer.
- Candidate detection is limited to directly relevant visible markers, avoiding
  large transitive overlap groups.
- Selected CPTs remain above ordinary load points while selected load points
  retain the highest interaction layer.
- CPT numbers are positioned and scaled more consistently in both the plan and
  hover inspector.
- CPT names remain available when imported data does not contain a display
  name.
- CPT links in the selection and pile-option tables use consistent localized
  terminology.
- Selected CPT markers now use an opaque, light accent fill and accent contour
  in every theme.
- Pile-size symbols in the legend inherit the active theme text color.
- The selected pile-option row has a subtle accent background in addition to
  its accent bar.
- Pile-option hover rows use a visible neutral background in light and dark

### Engineering Model

The pile-option calculation model, foundation-resistance checks, and greedy
optimization behavior are unchanged in this release. The changes primarily
improve inspection, marker selection, terminology, and visual feedback.
