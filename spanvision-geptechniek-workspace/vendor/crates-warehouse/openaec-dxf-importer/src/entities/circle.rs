//! DXF `CIRCLE` entity (group code 0 = "CIRCLE").

//! Reference: AutoCAD DXF Reference, AcDbCircle subclass marker `100
//! AcDbCircle`, group codes `10/20/30` (centre) and `40` (radius).

//! Tessellated as 64 chords around the full sweep — good enough for
//! print-resolution output; the consumer can re-tessellate at a
//! finer resolution if a higher-quality preview is needed.
