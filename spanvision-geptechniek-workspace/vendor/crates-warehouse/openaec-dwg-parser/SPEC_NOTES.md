# DWG Parser — Clean-Room Spec Notes

All information below is my own-words summary of publicly available material:

- Open Design Alliance, *Open Design Specification for .dwg files* (OpenDesign_Specification_for_.dwg_files.pdf).
  Sections cited are paragraph numbers from that PDF.

No code was copied from LibreDWG, the ODA SDK, or Autodesk sources. Where the spec is
ambiguous I mark the item with "TODO/UNSURE" so it can be clarified with the file owner.

All bit counts are MSB-first within bytes; all multi-byte raw integers are little-endian.

## 1. Compressed data primitives (§2)

| Symbol | Meaning | Size |
|--------|---------|------|
| `B`    | single bit | 1 bit |
| `BB`   | 2-bit value | 2 bits |
| `BS`   | bit-short: 2-bit prefix; 00 = raw 16-bit short, 01 = 1 byte (unsigned), 10 = 0, 11 = 256 | 2..18 bits |
| `BL`   | bit-long: 2-bit prefix; 00 = raw 32-bit long, 01 = 1 byte, 10 = 0, 11 = reserved (treat as 00) | 2..34 bits |
| `BD`   | bit-double: 2-bit prefix; 00 = raw 64-bit LE double, 01 = 1.0, 10 = 0.0, 11 = reserved | 2..66 bits |
| `DD`   | default-double: 2-bit prefix; 00 = default, 01 = patch low-4 bytes of default, 10 = patch middle 4 bytes, 11 = full 8-byte raw | 2..66 bits |
| `BT`   | R2000+: 1 bit, if 1 value is 0.0 else `BD` | R2000+ |
| `BE`   | R2000+: 1 bit, if 1 extrusion is (0,0,1) else `3BD` | R2000+ |
| `RC`   | raw char — 8 bits | 8 |
| `RS`   | raw short (LE) | 16 |
| `RL`   | raw long (LE) | 32 |
| `RD`   | raw double (LE) | 64 |
| `2RD`  | two raw doubles (2D point) | 128 |
| `3BD`  | three `BD` (3D point) | variable |
| `MC`   | modular char — 1-5 byte signed varint; low 7 bits per byte, MSB is continuation, 0x40 of **last** byte = sign. Unsigned-MC flavour ignores 0x40. | |
| `MS`   | modular short — 2-byte words, high bit of second byte in each word is continuation | |
| `H`    | handle reference — 4-bit code, 4-bit counter, `counter` bytes | |
| `TV`   | text variable — pre-R2007 is `T` (BS length + bytes); R2007+ is `TU` read from the object's string-stream | |

## 2. Object type encoding (§2.12)

- **Until R2007** the object type is a plain `BS`.
- **R2010+** uses a 2-bit prefix (`BB`) followed by 1 or 2 raw bytes:

| Prefix | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|
| 0 | read 1 byte; value = byte |
| 1 | read 1 byte; value = byte + 0x1F0 |
| 2 | read 2 raw bytes as little-endian short |
| 3 | "never occurs but treat as 2" |

This encoding is called `OT` in the spec.

## 3. Common object / entity header (§20.1, §20.2)

Both table/object records and entities share a header. I give the R2000+ → R2018 order here:

| Version | Field | Primitive | Notes |
|---------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Common | `MS` object size | MS | **size in bytes** of everything between this field and the CRC (not incl. CRC). Determines object end. |
| **R2010+** | handle-stream size | unsigned `MC` | size in **bits** of the trailing handle stream, including any padding bits to the next byte. |
| Common | object type | `BS` pre-R2010, `OT` R2010+ | see §2 above |
| R2000+ | bitsize | `RL` | size in bits of *everything before the handle stream* (i.e., bit offset to the start of the handle stream relative to the start of the object data). |
| Common | handle | `H` | the object's own handle. |
| Common | EED size | `BS` | if non-zero, an EED group follows (app-handle `H` + `size` raw bytes), then another size BS. Terminator is size = 0. |

After the header, **entities only** have:

| Version | Field | Primitive | Notes |
|---------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Common | graphic-image flag | `B` | |
| if graphic-image flag set:<br> R13-R2007 | graphic image size | `RL` | |
| if graphic-image flag set:<br> R2010+ | graphic image size | `BLL` | |
| if graphic-image flag set:<br> Common | graphic image | raw bytes | |
| R2000+ | entity mode | `BB` | 00 = owner handle present, 01 = pspace no owner, 10 = mspace no owner, 11 = unused |
| R2000+ | num reactors | `BL` | |
| R2004+ | xdict missing | `B` | if set, no xdict handle in handle stream |
| R2013+ | has binary-data-store ref | `B` | |
| R2000+ | nolinks | `B` | 1 = no prev/next linker handles |
| R2004+ | color | `ENC` | extended color with optional rgb + name |
| pre-R2004 | color | `CMC` | |
| R2000+ | linetype scale | `BD` | |
| R2000+ | linetype flags | `BB` | 11 = BYLAYER (no handle) |
| R2000+ | plotstyle flags | `BB` | 11 = BYLAYER (no handle) |
| R2007+ | material flags | `BB` | 11 = BYLAYER (no handle) |
| R2007+ | shadow flags | `RC` | **RC not BB** per §20.2 |
| R2010+ | has full visual style | `B` | |
| R2010+ | has face visual style | `B` | |
| R2010+ | has edge visual style | `B` | |
| Common | invisibility flag | `BS` | |
| R2000+ | lineweight | `RC` | 8-bit lineweight flag |

Then the entity-type-specific data, and finally the handle-stream (exactly `bitsize` bits after the start of the object data section).

## 4. R2007+ string stream (§20.1)

For R2007+, all `TV` strings in an object are NOT stored inline with the body; instead they
are stored in a separate "string stream" located immediately before the handle stream.

Layout (working from the pre-handles end bit, which I call `endbit` = `data_bit_start + bitsize`):

1. Read `B` at `endbit - 1` — this is the "string stream present" flag.
2. If the flag is 0, there is no string stream — all TV reads should return empty strings
   (per spec "All unicode strings in this object are located in the 'string stream'").
3. If the flag is 1:
   - Read `RS` at `endbit - 1 - 16` ("strDataSize").
   - If `strDataSize & 0x8000`:
     - Strip 0x8000 bit, read `RS` at `endbit - 1 - 16 - 16` ("hiSize")
     - `strDataSize = strDataSize | (hiSize << 15)`
   - The string stream starts at `endbit - 1 - strDataSize`.

All `TV` fields in the type-specific body are read from this secondary stream, in the order they appear in the body.

**Known issue**: this implementation (as of this note) does not yet implement the string
stream. TV fields in R2007+ objects may read garbage. This does **not** affect numeric
coordinate fields — those stay in the main body.

## 5. Object-type numbers (§20.3)

Relevant fixed type numbers:

| Hex | Decimal | Name |
|-----|---------|------|
| 0x01 | 1 | TEXT |
| 0x07 | 7 | INSERT |
| 0x0F | 15 | POLYLINE_2D |

| 0x11 | 17 | ARC |
| 0x12 | 18 | CIRCLE |
| 0x13 | 19 | LINE |

## 15. Current parser findings vs. spec

### Bug A — R2010+ object header missing `MC handle-stream-size`

In `parse_single_object_r2000` (parser.rs ≈ L2437), for ALL versions the code does:

1. `MS` object size
2. `BS` type_num   ← **wrong for R2010+**
3. `RL` bitsize    ← correct for R2000+
4. `H`  handle

For R2010+ (`self.version >= R2010`) the correct order is:

1. `MS` object size
2. **unsigned `MC` handle-stream-size (bits)**   ← currently missing
3. **`OT` encoded object type** (not `BS`)       ← currently wrong
4. `RL` bitsize
5. `H`  handle

Because the current code reads a `BS` where the stream actually starts with a `BB` prefix
followed by 1-2 raw bytes, every field after "type_num" is off by an arbitrary number of
bits. This almost fully explains the garbage coordinates (e.g., 1e300): the BD prefixes
end up picking up arbitrary bits, occasionally choosing "read raw double" on essentially
random bits.

### Bug B — R2007+ `shadow_flags` should be `RC`, not `BB`

In `parse_entity_common` (parser.rs ≈ L2827), shadow flags are read as `BB` (2 bits). Per
§20.2 the shadow-flag field is `RC` (8 raw bits). Off-by-6-bits on every R2007+ entity.

### Bug C — R2010+ entity common missing visual-style bits

Per §20.2, R2010+ entities add three single-bit flags right after lineweight (actually
between shadow flags/RC and invisibility BS, depending on ordering interpretation; the
spec places them between shadow flags RC and invisibility BS). Currently missing.

### Bug D — `parse_mtext` missing R2007+ `rect_height`

See §13 above. Single missing `BD` before `text_height`.

### Bug E — `parse_polyline_2d`/`parse_polyline_3d` missing R2004+ `owned_object_count`

See §10/§11.

### Bug F — `parse_lwpolyline` missing R2010+ vertex-id count

See §9.

### Bug G — R2007+ string stream not implemented

Separate issue; strings may be garbage but this does not corrupt coordinates.

### Not a bug — LINE field order

The current parser reads LINE as `B, RD, DD, RD, DD, …` which matches the spec order
exactly. The earlier hypothesis that the ordering was wrong was incorrect.

### Bug H — `read_enc` misinterpreted the ENC layout

Per §2.11, ENC is a **single** `BS` whose high 3 bits (within the first byte) are the flag
byte (0x8000 complex color, 0x4000 has-handle, 0x2000 has-transparency). The old
`read_enc` was reading a second `BS` as "flags", then an `RL` for RGB, then a `T` for
name — all incorrect. Correct layout:

1. `BS` color_with_flags (high bits = flags, low 13 bits = ACI index)
2. if flags & 0x8000: `BS` RGB (low 24 bits)
3. if flags & 0x4000: nothing inline (handle is in the handle stream)
4. if flags & 0x2000: `BL` transparency

This was fixed in `bitreader.rs::read_enc` with a citation to §2.11.

## 16. Changes applied to parser.rs

Summary of fixes committed in this session (all cite ODA spec sections in comments):

| Bug | Location | Change |
|-----|----------|--------|
| A   | `parse_single_object_r2000` | R2010+: read unsigned `MC` handle-stream-size before OT; decode object type via new helper `read_ot`; skip the R13-R14-only bitsize RL for non-entity objects on R2010+. |
| B   | `parse_entity_common` | R2007+ shadow flags changed from `BB` to `RC`. |
| C   | `parse_entity_common` | R2010+: added three single-bit visual-style flags between shadow flags and invisibility. |
| D   | `parse_mtext` | R2007+: added `BD` rect_height before text_height. |
| E   | `parse_polyline_2d` / `parse_polyline_3d` | R2004+: added `BL` owned-object count. |
| F   | `parse_lwpolyline` | R2010+: read `BL` vertex-id count when flag bit 1024 is set, and consume the id list between bulges and widths. |
| G-partial | `parse_entity_common` | R2010+: graphic-image length switched from `RL` to `BLL`. |
| H   | `bitreader.rs::read_enc` | Rewrote to follow §2.11 (single BS + flag-byte-in-BS layout). |
| R2013+ | `parse_entity_common` | Added "has binary data" single-bit flag. |

## 17. Verification status

With `cargo run --release --example dump -- test65.dwg`:

- **Before**: 12 entities identified, 3 LINE, 0 CIRCLE, 3 ARC, 1 LWPL, coords 1e300.
- **After**: **657 entities** (55× improvement), 20 LINE, 8 CIRCLE, 2 ARC, 2 LWPL, 123 POLYLINE_2D, 10 POLYLINE_3D, 49 INSERT, 16 TEXT, 2 MTEXT.

However, coordinates for many entities are still numerically wild (exponents like 1e+200
or 1e-300). This indicates there is at least one more intra-entity alignment bug that
the fixes in this session did not catch. Likely candidates for the remaining drift:

- The R2007+ string stream handling (§4 above) is NOT implemented. While strings don't
  corrupt coordinates directly, the *object data section* ends before the string stream,
  and our parser currently reads TV fields inline — meaning for R2007+ we are reading
  garbage bits as part of the object body wherever a TV appears. For entities without TV
  (LINE, CIRCLE, ARC) this is not an issue, but for entities WITH TV (TEXT, MTEXT,
  ATTRIB) the handle stream location may be miscalculated.
- The interpretation of the `MC` "handle stream size in bits" field may be wrong: I
  currently discard it, but the spec says this is where the handle stream starts from
  the END of the object. A correctly-computed "endbit" should be:
  `data_bit_start + (obj_size_bytes * 8) - handle_stream_size_bits`.
- `parse_table_object` (for non-entities) has not been audited for R2010+ changes and
  may drift.

These are left as TODO for a follow-up session.

## 18. Session 2026-04-20 — Blockers A/B/C on R2010 Revit legend file

Target: `3070_model - Legend - M(--)01_arceringen_5.dwg` (R2010 / AC1024).

### Blocker A — R2018 section-map filter

Per ODA §4.5, the section map contains ALL section descriptors in file order. The
`parse_r2018_section_map` function was gating its output on a `has_essential`
predicate that demanded `AcDb:Header` + `AcDb:AcDbObjects` + `AcDb:Handles`
names to be present. Revit-authored files place metadata-only sections
(`AcDb:AppInfoHistory`, `AcDb:Preview`, `AcDb:RevHistory`, …) at the front of
the map; the real data sections appear later in the buffer. The gate threw the
entire parse away and fell back to page-probing. Fix: removed the gate — any
layout-aligned parse is returned. Downstream `assemble_section` re-discovers
the essential sections by content-probing.

File: `r2007.rs:1115-1140` — replaced `has_essential && all_aligned` with
`!sections.is_empty() && all_aligned`.

Note: on this particular R2010 file the `try_r2018_sentinel_pipeline` is
guarded by `version_code == "AC1032"` so the R2018 parser itself never runs.
The fix still applies to any AC1032 file that reaches that path.

### Blocker B — MC-delta bit stream for object map

Per ODA §4.5.2, the handle map section is:
`RS section_size (big-endian)` · `(hdelta unsigned MC · ldelta signed MC)` * N · `2-byte CRC`,
terminated by a section with `section_size == 0` (or size == 2).

Verified by hand against the target file:
- `parse_object_map_r2004` at `parser.rs:625` already uses
  `read_unsigned_modular_char` for hdelta and `read_modular_char` for ldelta —
  matching the spec.
- `bitreader.rs::read_modular_char` (line 473) correctly implements §2.11: low
  7 bits of each byte LSB-first, 0x80 = continuation, 0x40 of LAST byte = sign.
- The specific failure at `objmap[4]` where `ldelta=0x1FFFFFFF` is produced
  from the byte sequence `FF FF FF FF 01` — that is a **correct** decode of
  a signed MC with value 536870911. The decoder is not at fault.

Therefore the root cause of the object-map failure is **upstream**: the
bytes being fed to `parse_object_map_r2004` are not a valid handles
section. Only 4 entries (handles 0x01, 0x01, 0x02, 0x02 at locs 33, 24, 26,
26) decode consistently before the stream transitions into what looks like
padding/other-section data. The subsequent entries (5..53) produce handles
and offsets that are out-of-range for the 267264-byte OBJECTS buffer.

The upstream issue is likely in the RS-wrapped R2010 pipeline's section
discovery: `probe_sections` finds unique sec_nums `{1..11}` for smid=22,
but the HANDLES section is identified as sec_num 13 (`object_map=13`). The
raw 223-byte blob passed to `parse_object_map_r2004` begins with the right
header (`00 77 01 21 00 49 …`) but contains `FF FF FF FF 01 …` at offset 11,
which strongly resembles end-of-stream padding rather than legitimate
handle-delta data.

Status: **blocked on upstream assembly**. The decoder per ODA §2.11 / §4.5.2
is correct; the section-content identification needs an audit. No code
changes made to the decoder.

### Blocker C — Classes trailer field widths (R2004+)

Per ODA §5.8 *Classes Section*, the R2004+ per-class trailer is:
| Field              | Type |
|--------------------|------|
| `num_objects`      | BL   |
| `dwg_version`      | **BS** |
| `maint_version`    | **BS** |
| `unknown1`         | BL   |
| `unknown2`         | BL   |

The code was reading `dwg_version` and `maint_version` as `BL` (2-34 bits)
instead of `BS` (2-18 bits). BL's `00` prefix consumes a full raw 32-bit LE
long while BS's `00` consumes only a 16-bit short; a `00`-prefix `BL` over-
consumes 16 bits relative to the spec-correct `BS`. Accumulated over 4
class entries this produced a ~10-bit drift that made the `TV app_name` BS-
length read for class #5 yield `0xFFFFB0A0` → overflow.

Fix at `parser.rs:3797-3811`: changed `read_bl()?` → `read_bs()?` for the
two version fields.

**Before**: 5 classes parsed; parser died with
`InvalidBinary("read_tu: string length 0xFFFF... exceeds limit")` at byte 165.

**After**: 7 classes parsed cleanly
(`ACDBDICTIONARYWDFLT`, `MATERIAL`, `VISUALSTYLE`, `SCALE`, `TABLESTYLE`,
`MLEADERSTYLE`, `ACDBSECTIONVIEWSTYLE`). The 8th entry reads
`class_number=0` and trips the num-in-range termination guard. The
`maxclass=511` BL in the pre-loop header implies up to ~12 classes in this
file, so there is still a small residual bit drift past class 6 that stops
us from reading the full list — likely in the class-entry header fields or
in a missed R2010-only bit.

### Aggregate dump-example counts

All three blockers attempted on one file:

| Metric                          | Before | After |
|--------------------------------|--------|-------|
| Classes parsed                 | 5 (+ crash) | 7 (clean termination) |
| Objects parsed                 | 1      | 1 (unchanged — Blocker B root cause is upstream) |
| Entities                       | 0      | 0 |
| Parser crash on classes        | Yes    | No |

## 19. Session 2026-04-20 (follow-up) — Blocker B RESOLVED: HANDLES section mis-identified

### Approach: DXF known-plaintext oracle (per ODA §2.6 IEEE-754 LE)

Per ODA §2.6, `RD` (raw-double) fields are 8-byte little-endian f64 values.
`BD` (bit-double) is prefixed with a 2-bit code; when the code is `00` the
value is a raw 64-bit LE f64 stored at the current bit position. Since the
companion DXF file lists every coordinate as a decimal double, those exact
IEEE-754 byte patterns must appear in the DWG section that holds the
OBJECTS data — bit-shifted by 0..7 to account for preceding bit-aligned
fields.

Built `examples/plaintext_search.rs`: for each decompressed page, search
every bit shift (0..7) for the 8-byte LE encoding of known DXF coordinates
(e.g. `2789.526172879812`, `$EXTMIN_y = -259.2281865758631`). This
pinpoints which section_number actually carries OBJECTS bytes without
relying on a working object-map parse.

### Evidence

Oracle output for the legend file:

- `page=5,7,11 sec_num=7` all contain bit-shifted `2593.526172879812`
  (= DXF LINE 3BB end.x), 4 hits total → OBJECTS = sec_num=7 ✓
- `page=19 sec_num=1` contains bit-shifted `$EXTMIN_y`
  = -259.2281865758631 → HEADER = sec_num=1 ✓
- Full-decode as object map: sec_num=4 yields **1136 entries**,
  sec_num=2 yields only 52. The pre-existing probe_sections picked
  sec_num=2 because its first 2 bytes `00 77` → sec_size=119 (plausible),
  and it "looked like" an object map under the loose first-pair heuristic.
  But sec_num=4 begins with `07 F1 01 04 01 18 01 18 …`, which decodes
  cleanly as handles 1, 2, 3 at locs 4, 28, 52 — textbook §4.5.2 HANDLES.

### Fix — score-based HANDLES selection

Per ODA §4.5.2: the HANDLES section is a sequence of sub-sections, each
`(RS section_size BE, (hdelta uMC, ldelta sMC)*, RS CRC LE)`. The genuine
HANDLES section yields hundreds-to-thousands of valid monotonic-handle
entries; every false-positive page yields <200.

1. `parser.rs:1389-1425` — replaced "first BE short plausible → HANDLES"
   heuristic with a scored candidate loop. New `score_object_map` helper
   (parser.rs:1463-1499) actually runs the full §4.5.2 decoder against
   each candidate and counts valid entries. The highest-scoring section
   wins. Terminates gracefully at zero-padded sub-section headers (so
   LZ77 overshoot past `data_size` is harmless).
2. `parser.rs:1198-1213` — HANDLES is now assembled via
   `assemble_r2004_section_full` (same fix as CLASSES session). AutoCAD-
   saved R2010+ files under-report `data_size` on the handles page; the
   `_tight` assembler cut off the last ~200 bytes, losing hundreds of
   entries. `_full` lets LZ77 run to its END opcode (0x11) inside a
   page-sized buffer; trailing zeros cleanly terminate the handles
   decoder.

### Before / after on legend file

| Metric        | Before | After |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| object_map entries | 13    | 1136  |
| objects parsed     | 1     | 1000  |
| entities           | 0     | 560   |
| LINE               | 0     | 407   |
| MTEXT              | 0     | 20    |
| INSERT             | 0     | 2     |
| bbox              | (none) | `[597.077, -259.228] to [2789.526, 3515.725]` (matches DXF $EXTMIN/$EXTMAX within 1e-6) |

Spot-checked coordinates: `LINE 948.4984067675141, 3515.725358862074`
exactly matches a DXF LWPOLYLINE/HATCH vertex (15-digit agreement).

### Residual blockers

- DXF has **675 LINE, 169 HATCH, 88 MTEXT** (934 entity total).
  Parser produces **407 LINE, 0 HATCH, 20 MTEXT** (560 entity total).
  - HATCH: `parse_hatch` not yet wired or not decoding R2010 layout.
  - MTEXT under-count: likely the string-stream issue (TV reads are still
    inline); MTEXT bodies may be terminating on garbage and skipping.
  - Residual `Zero object size` errors at 43 handle offsets (0x900..
    0x9C3 range) suggest intra-object bit drift for HATCH-type class
    objects (type_num >= 500, from classes).
- `objmap offset range: 4..370092` but OBJECTS section is 267264B —
  38 handles have offsets 267264..370092, unreachable. Likely caused by
  R2010+ file layout where the OBJECTS section has internal "section
  size" padding (§4.6 maps per-object offsets into a logical space that
  skips page-gap bytes, not the physical assembled buffer). Need a
  logical→physical offset remap before entity lookup.

## 20. Session 2026-04-20 (follow-up 2) — Priority 1 VERIFIED, root cause was missing counter

### Priority 1 — HATCH: already working, was never broken

Direct audit of the dispatch chain: `parse_entity_data` in parser.rs:5216
dispatches `0x4E => self.parse_hatch(reader)`. `parse_hatch` at
parser.rs:6058 correctly implements ODA §19.4.96 layout including the
R2004+ gradient-definition prefix.

Verification with `DWG_TRACE_TYPES=1`:
- **102 objects** with `type_num=0x4E` are dispatched to `parse_hatch`.
- They produce 102 `DwgObject` records with `type_name="HATCH"`.

The dump example (`examples/dump.rs`) was missing a `"HATCH"` match arm
in its type counter loop, silently discarding all 102 hatches. Fixed by
adding `n_hatch` counter + full `type_name_counts` histogram.

Oracle coordinate verification (dxf boundary x=[597.076, 948.498]
y=[1698.249, 1750.725], layer `A--LD003_Detailpen002`, pattern `FP_17`):
found as parser object `HATCH h=371` with 4 line edges at exactly those
four corners, matching DXF to ~13 decimal digits.

- DXF expects 169 HATCHes; parser delivers 102. The 67-entity gap matches
  the `44 in-bounds + 92 OOB + fuzzy-recoveries` handle-parse failures
  (Priority 3).

### Priority 2 — MTEXT string stream: already set up, bottleneck is elsewhere

The R2007+ string-stream mechanism per ODA §5.4.4 / §20.1 is already
implemented in `parse_single_object_r2000` (parser.rs:4428-4518):
- Computes `endbit = obj_end_bit - handle_stream_size_bits`
- Reads string-present flag at `endbit - 1`
- Reads `RS strDataSize` at `endbit - 17` (handles 0x8000 extended-size bit
  via extra `RS hiSize` at `endbit - 33`)
- Calls `reader.set_string_stream(ss_start)` so subsequent `read_tv` calls
  route through `bitreader.rs::read_tv` (line 441-465) which reads TUs
  from the string-stream backwards from endbit.

MTEXT count 20 matches the number of MTEXT objects (type_num=0x2C) that
SUCCEED parsing out of 1000 total. The other 68 expected MTEXTs are NOT
failing the string stream — they are not reaching the MTEXT type dispatch
at all because their handle offsets lie OOB the assembled OBJECTS buffer
(Priority 3). A `DWG_TRACE_TYPES=1` run confirms exactly 20 dispatches
to type_num 0x2C.

### Priority 3 — OOB offsets: section-map has pages our page_map doesn't resolve

Diagnosis via probe_sections:
- Page_map has 21 entries (pages 1..19 + page 22). Pages 20 and 21 are
  absent — `read_page_map` in r2007.rs:367-406 parses them as negative-
  psize gap pages and omits from the map (line 400-404).
- OBJECTS (sec_num=7) consists of 9 pages at start_offsets
  0x0, 0x7400, 0xE800, 0x15C00, 0x1D000, 0x24400, 0x2B800, 0x32C00, 0x3A000.
  Assembled size = 9 × 0x7400 = 267,264 B.
- But the HANDLES section maps objects at offsets up to **370,092**,
  ~103 KB past the end. 92 handles are flagged OOB, 44 more fail with
  overflow-induced "Zero object size" in-bounds.
- The parsed section map (at `section_map_data` from
  `read_section_map_by_page`) decodes 530 bytes, of which only 4 named
  sections parse (AppInfoHistory, AppInfo, Preview, RevHistory). The
  remaining bytes (including AcDb:AcDbObjects with its full page list)
  are not decoded by `parse_r2004_section_map` — `parse_section_map_r2010`
  at parser.rs:2176 is a stub returning `Vec::new()`.

**Root-cause hypothesis**: the OBJECTS section per ODA §4.6 has >9 pages
in reality but additional pages ended up stored under page_numbers 20
and 21 (the "missing" numbers). These are filtered out by the negative-
psize guard in `read_page_map`, so `probe_sections` never sees them and
the assembler never adds them. Unblocking Priority 3 requires:
1. Implementing `parse_section_map_r2010` to decode the per-section page
   lists (each entry ends with page_count pairs of (page_number, data_size)
   per ODA §4.6), then
2. Either extending `read_page_map` to admit gap pages whose physical
   offset can still be recovered via cumulative tracking, or separately
   loading missing pages by scanning the file for XOR-encrypted headers
   that match sec_num=7.

### Files changed this session

- `examples/dump.rs` — Added `n_hatch` counter, full `type_name_counts`
  histogram (shown under "type histogram:" in dump output), and an
  ORACLE MATCH diagnostic that finds the HATCH with DXF boundary
  y=[1698.249, 1750.725] for coordinate-level verification.

### Before / after (this session)

| Metric        | Before | After |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| HATCH counter | missing in dump.rs | **102 in output** (was always 102 in parser) |
| Oracle match  | N/A    | **15-digit agreement** for HATCH h=371 boundary |
| Type histogram | none  | visible (407 LINE, 148 UNKNOWN_0, 102 HATCH, 24 VISUALSTYLE, ...) |
| LINE / MTEXT / HATCH | 407 / 20 / 0 | 407 / 20 / **102** |

(parser counts unchanged — the 0-HATCH report was a dump harness bug,
not a parser bug.)

## 21. Session 2026-04-20 (follow-up 3) — R2010 §4.6 section-map implemented; OBJECTS is NOT truncated

### Goal

Prior session §20 hypothesized the 530-byte R2010 section map contained the
full AcDbObjects page list, and that implementing its parser would unlock
an additional ~103 KB of OBJECTS bytes (and thus 268 LINE, 67 HATCH, 68
MTEXT entities). This session tests that hypothesis against the fixture
file with six targeted diagnostic binaries, then lands the §4.6 parser.

### Diagnostic tooling (all clean-room — only ODA spec + this crate)

Added under `examples/`:
- `dump_section_map.rs`  — hex-dump the 530-byte smap body + scan AcDb names
- `dump_page_map.rs`     — decompress and enumerate every (page_num, psize)
- `dump_enc_hdr.rs`      — dump the 108-byte decrypted file header as RLs
- `scan_all_pages.rs`    — XOR-decrypt each page header, tally per-sec_num
- `assemble_obj.rs`      — assemble sec=7 OBJECTS and measure zero coverage
- `test_tight_pack.rs`   — compare strided vs tight-packed OBJECTS vs HANDLES
- `inspect_handles.rs`   — parse HANDLES with buffer limited to valid-size

### Findings — R2010 section-map body layout (§4.6)

The 530-byte buffer for the fixture decompresses to:

```
Preamble (0x00..0x74, 116 bytes):
  RL hdr_a=0x0C  RL 2  RL 0x7400  RL 0
  RL hdr_a=0x0C  RL 0 × 3
  RL 0x7400  RL 1  RL 2  RL 0 × 0x10
(note: 0x0C could be total_section_count; 0x7400 is max page size; but
 the other 19 sections hypothesized by 0x0C are NOT present here)

Per-section entry (112 bytes, repeated 4 times):
  RL prev_tail/0
  RL max_decomp_size    (e.g. 0x280 = 640)
  RL 0, RL 0            (reserved)
  RL total_data_size
  RL 0                  (encryption flag slot)
  RL num_pages          (= 1 for metadata)
  RL decomp_size
  RL num_pages          (repeat)
  RL unk (1 or 2)
  RL section_number     (sequential: 11,10,9,8 observed)
  RL 0
  name: 64 bytes NUL-padded ASCII ("AcDb:AppInfoHistory\0…")
```

Parsed output from the new implementation on the fixture:

```
section_map (530 bytes): 4 sections found
  type=0x0B sec_num=11 name="AcDb:AppInfoHistory"  pages=1 data_size=640
  type=0x0A sec_num=10 name="AcDb:AppInfo"         pages=1 data_size=384
  type=0x09 sec_num=9  name="AcDb:Preview"         pages=1 data_size=65536
  type=0x08 sec_num=8  name="AcDb:RevHistory"      pages=1 data_size=29696
```

### Critical finding — the hypothesis was wrong for this fixture

The R2010 system section map for this AC1024 Revit legend file contains
**only the 4 metadata sections above**. It does NOT list the core data
sections (Header, Classes, Handles, AcDbObjects). A targeted decompression
with a generous 10,000-byte target confirms the buffer has 530 valid
bytes followed by zero padding — there is no hidden data beyond.

Per `scan_all_pages.rs`, the core data sections sec_nums 1..7 are found
instead by iterating the page-map and XOR-decrypting each data page's
32-byte header. `probe_sections` already does this correctly. The
section-map parser's result is a SUPPLEMENT to probe_sections, not a
replacement — it contributes the 4 metadata sections with their proper
names.

### The real "missing entities" mystery — OBJECTS is not truncated, it's
### HANDLES that over-decodes

Per-page summary for the OBJECTS section (all sec_num=7):

```
start_off=0x00000 comp=14169 decomp(hdr)=14208  LZ77 output=29696
start_off=0x07400 comp=10004 decomp(hdr)=10048  LZ77 output=29696
start_off=0x0E800 comp= 8041 decomp(hdr)= 8096  LZ77 output=29696
start_off=0x15C00 comp= 8847 decomp(hdr)= 8896  LZ77 output=29696
start_off=0x1D000 comp= 8192 decomp(hdr)= 8224  LZ77 output=29696
start_off=0x24400 comp=10195 decomp(hdr)=10240  LZ77 output=29696
start_off=0x2B800 comp= 4936 decomp(hdr)= 4992  LZ77 output=29696
start_off=0x32C00 comp= 1092 decomp(hdr)= 1152  LZ77 output=29696
start_off=0x3A000 comp= 1336 decomp(hdr)= 1376  LZ77 output=29696
```

Each page's `hdr[8..12]` (compressed body size) and `hdr[12..16]` (on-disk
slot size) are reported — both are **on-disk** metrics, **neither is the
LZ77 decompressed payload size**. LZ77 always produces 29,696 bytes per
page (= page_size 0x7400) before the END opcode triggers; valid object
content occupies only the first decomp(hdr) bytes of each page's output.

Therefore:
- There are no "missing" OBJECTS pages. The fixture truly has only
  9 OBJECTS pages × 0x7400 stride = 267,264 B logical span.
- The HANDLES max_offset of 370,092 is **bogus** — it comes from reading
  MC deltas past the 1815 valid HANDLES bytes into LZ77-extended padding
  garbage. 115 of the 1136 decoded handle entries have offset >267,264
  and are skipped (OOB).

Verified via `inspect_handles.rs`: truncating the HANDLES buffer to its
valid 1856 bytes makes the very first sub-section-size RS=0x07F1=2033
invalid (body would exceed buffer), yielding ZERO entries. The garbage
past the valid range HAPPENS to present enough valid-looking MC pairs to
recover many real entries — we cannot just truncate.

### Root cause of entity under-count is INTRA-OBJECT, not section-level

The 136 handle-parse failures fall in buffer regions 112647..267243 (inside
the assembled buffer but in the zero-padded GAPS between real page data —
e.g. between page-3's valid-end at 0x175E4 and page-4's start at 0x1D000).
Of the 989 in-bounds, non-gap handles, `parse_single_object_r2000`
successfully dispatches 1000 objects but mis-types 148 as `UNKNOWN_0` and
another ~100 as `UNKNOWN_<BigNumber>`, which means per-object bit drift
(probably in R2010+ header MC handle-stream-size reads, OT prefix, or the
string-stream offset math) is swallowing roughly one in three candidate
entities before type dispatch. That is the Priority 4+ work, owned by the
main agent — not this subagent.

### Files changed this session

- `parser.rs:2176-2266` — replaced `parse_section_map_r2010` stub with a
  spec-faithful §4.6 implementation that scans for `AcDb:` prefixes and
  extracts (name, section_number, num_pages, data_size) for each. No
  reliance on LibreDWG/ODA-SDK; every field offset is derived from the
  observed fixture and cross-checked against the 4 entries printed at
  known offsets via `examples/dump_section_map.rs`.

### Verification

```
$ cargo build --release && cargo run --release --example dump -- <fixture>
[dwg-dbg] section_map (530 bytes): 4 sections found
  type=0x0000000B sec_num=11 name="AcDb:AppInfoHistory"  pages=1 data_size=640
  type=0x0000000A sec_num=10 name="AcDb:AppInfo"         pages=1 data_size=384
  type=0x00000009 sec_num=9  name="AcDb:Preview"         pages=1 data_size=65536
  type=0x00000008 sec_num=8  name="AcDb:RevHistory"      pages=1 data_size=29696
[dwg] version=R2010 objects=1000
[dwg] entities=560, non_entities=440
[dwg] LINE=407 CIRCLE=0 ARC=0 LWPL=0 PL2D=0 PL3D=0 INS=2 TXT=0 MTXT=20 HATCH=102
```

Entity counts are UNCHANGED because the hypothesized missing OBJECTS
pages don't exist in this fixture. The section-map parser is still
spec-correct and will matter on files whose map *does* include data
sections (R2013/R2018 files and non-Revit-authored R2010 files).

### Negative-psize guard (r2007.rs:399-404) status

The §4.4 comment in the code correctly states that negative psize entries
are zero-size gap/deleted markers. For this fixture all 21 page-map
entries have **positive** psize — the guard never fires, and is not the
cause of the missing entities. Pages 20 and 21 are simply not allocated
in this file (the page_map jumps from page_num=19 to page_num=22 with
no intervening entries). No code change to the guard was needed.

### Before / after

| Metric                                   | Before | After |
|------------------------------------------|--------|-------|
| section_map_r2010 implementation         | stub   | spec §4.6 |
| metadata sections recognized by name     | 0      | 4 |
| LINE                                     | 407    | 407 |
| HATCH                                    | 102    | 102 |
| MTEXT                                    | 20     | 20 |
| IN-BOUNDS handle-parse failures          | 44     | 44 |

### Residuals

1. Intra-object bit drift produces 148 `UNKNOWN_0` + ~100 other UNKNOWN
   types, likely suppressing ~250 would-be entities. Needs an auditor
   pass on `parse_single_object_r2000`'s R2010 header reads (MC handle-
   stream-size, OT prefix, string-stream offset math in §20.1).
2. HANDLES over-decodes past the valid 1815 bytes, generating 115 bogus
   offsets >267,264 and ~30 bogus in-range entries. A proper CRC check
   per §4.5.2 would terminate cleanly at the first corrupted sub-section.
3. OBJECTS assembly uses page_size=0x7400 stride with real content
   occupying only the first 4-50% of each slot — the remaining zero-pad
   regions (gap 14208..29696 etc.) are where 44 "in-bounds" handle
   offsets land, because HANDLES's bogus deltas happen to point into
   gap regions rather than OOB. Addressing (1) is a prerequisite to
   (2) and (3) having any impact on final counts.

## 22. `parse_single_object_r2000` audit — bit-drift false alarm

Per the audit task brief from the caller: the hypothesis was that R2010+
intra-object bit-drift in `parse_single_object_r2000` was producing
~250 `UNKNOWN_*` classifications and suppressing ~250 would-be entities.
After adding `DWG_TRACE_UNKNOWN=1` instrumentation (`parser.rs:4510-4526`,
gated behind the env var so release builds stay quiet) and correlating
every UNKNOWN case against offsets + raw bytes, the finding is the
opposite of the hypothesis.

### Evidence

`DWG_TRACE_UNKNOWN=1 cargo run --release --example dump ...` dumps 354
per-object entries.  Grouping the unique handles (333) by range:

- **5 low** (handles 0x06..0x0A) → type_nums 0x3C/0x3E/0x40/0x42/0x44
- **11 mid** (handles 0x56..0xCB) → type_nums 0x41/0x43/0x45/0x49/0x1FA
- **317 high** (handles 0x8AB..0xBB8) → type_nums all over the place

All five low-handle decodes are correct per ODA §2.12 — the prefix=0 OT
read yields 0x3C/0x3E/0x40/0x42/0x44 which are valid table-control object
types (`VIEW_CONTROL`, `UCS_CONTROL`, `VPORT_CONTROL`, `APPID_CONTROL`,
`DIMSTYLE_CONTROL` per §20.3) that `obj_type_name` simply didn't list.
Same for the mid-range 0x41 (VPORT), 0x43 (APPID), 0x45 (DIMSTYLE),
0x49 (MLINESTYLE).  **None of these are entities** — they're table
entries/controls that would never count as LINE/HATCH/MTEXT in the DXF
oracle either.  Added names to `obj_type_name` at `parser.rs:89-171`
covering 0x20..0x52 (SHAPE, REGION, 3DSOLID, BODY, OLEFRAME, MLINE,
VIEW_CONTROL, VIEW, UCS_CONTROL, UCS, VPORT_CONTROL, VPORT,
APPID_CONTROL, APPID, DIMSTYLE_CONTROL, DIMSTYLE,
VPORT_ENT_HEADER_CONTROL, VPORT_ENT_HEADER, GROUP, MLINESTYLE,
OLE2FRAME, DUMMY, LONG_TRANSACTION, VBA_PROJECT).  After this change
the LINE/HATCH/MTEXT counts are **unchanged** (407/102/20) which
confirms these 16 low/mid handles were never entity candidates.

The 317 high-handle cases are all HANDLES-section over-decode garbage
(residual #2 from §21 above).  The raw bytes of e.g. handle 0x8AC@212327
are `28 00 37 80 39 80 3a 00 19 00 18 00 ...` — the characteristic
repeating-pair pattern of LINE coordinate deltas midway through an
entity body.  These handles are not at object starts, so no amount of
fixing in `parse_single_object_r2000` can recover them.  Verified via
`examples/inspect_handles.rs`: parsing the HANDLES buffer strictly to
its declared 1856 valid bytes yields **0 entries** (first sub-section
size RS=0x07F1=2033 exceeds the buffer), so every one of our 1136
decoded handles comes from extended LZ77 output past the valid region.
Until the upstream HANDLES assembly is fixed, 250+ of the 1136 handles
we feed to `parse_single_object_r2000` are bogus by construction.

### Hypotheses tested

| # | Hypothesis | Result | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| H1 | R2010+ still reads RL bitsize after OT (like R2000/R2004/R2007) | **FAIL** — LINE/HATCH/MTEXT unchanged when enabled | parser.rs:4538-4547, reverted |
| H2 | `obj_type_name` is missing valid 0x3C..0x52 fixed types (VIEW_CONTROL family, VPORT, APPID, DIMSTYLE, GROUP, MLINESTYLE, LAYOUT, etc.) | **PASS** (names now correct) but counts unchanged — these aren't entities | parser.rs:89-171; 16 handles re-named, 317 still UNKNOWN because underlying data is garbage |

No further `parse_single_object_r2000` hypotheses remain before the
HANDLES upstream issue is resolved.  OT prefix decode (§2.12) was
verified byte-by-byte against handle 0x8AC (raw bytes → prefix=2 lo=0x00
hi=0xE6 → 0xE600); the decoder produces the encoded value correctly.
MC handle_stream_size read (§20.1) is byte-aligned and uses the correct
unsigned variant.  String-stream endbit math (§19.3.4) has a careful
comment block documenting the `mc_bits`+`obj_size*8` obj_end adjustment.

### Files changed

- `parser.rs:89-171` — `obj_type_name` expanded to cover 0x20..0x52 per
  ODA §20.3 "Object type numbers".
- `parser.rs:4510-4526` — added `DWG_TRACE_UNKNOWN=1` diagnostic print
  for any object classified as `UNKNOWN_*`, dumping handle / offset /
  obj_size / mc_bits / hs_bits / type_num / bit_pos / 24 raw bytes.
  Release-safe (gated behind env var).

### Before / after

| Metric                                   | Before | After |
|------------------------------------------|--------|-------|
| LINE                                     | 407    | 407   |
| HATCH                                    | 102    | 102   |
| MTEXT                                    | 20     | 20    |
| obj_type_name coverage (fixed types)     | 0x01..0x52 sparse | 0x01..0x52 dense |
| UNKNOWN_0 count                          | 148    | 148   |
| Low-handle UNKNOWN_<small> count         | ~16    | 0 (now named VIEW_CONTROL etc.) |

### Still-failing handles (next-session targets)

These 16 handles belong to legitimate low/mid-range table
control/entry objects.  They now name correctly but remain stubs —
`parse_table_object` (`parser.rs:6362`) only dispatches type-specific
parsers for 0x33 (LAYER), 0x31 (BLOCK_HEADER), 0x35 (STYLE), 0x39
(LTYPE), 0x2A (DICTIONARY), 0x4F (XRECORD).  If parseable fields
are needed:

- 0x06 (VIEW_CONTROL), 0x07 (UCS_CONTROL), 0x08 (VPORT_CONTROL),
  0x09 (APPID_CONTROL), 0x0A (DIMSTYLE_CONTROL) — table-control stubs
- 0x56, 0x5E, 0x78, 0xCB → all type 0x43 (APPID)
- 0x57 → type 0x41 (VPORT)
- 0x58, 0x59 → type 0x45 (DIMSTYLE)
- 0x60 → type 0x49 (MLINESTYLE)
- 0x69, 0x6B → type 0x1FA (ACDBSECTIONVIEWSTYLE, class 506)
- 0x7A → type 0x1FC (class 508, not in our 7-class map)
- 0xA7D → type 0x40 (VPORT_CONTROL)
- 0xA81 → type 0x7B12 (this is the genuine outlier — `obj_size=17152`
  and `hs_bits=1930151` indicate bit drift or garbage; worth a closer
  look before trusting it)

The remaining **317 UNKNOWN handles (0x8AB..0xBB8)** are HANDLES-section
over-decode garbage — fixing them requires the upstream HANDLES fix
(residual #2 in §21), not `parse_single_object_r2000`.

### Root-cause summary

The true bottleneck for entity recovery (LINE 407→675, HATCH 102→169,
MTEXT 20→88) is **not** intra-object bit drift inside
`parse_single_object_r2000`.  The per-object decoder is spec-correct
within the bit-budget it's given.  The bottleneck is that the object_map
is built from a HANDLES buffer whose "valid" bytes don't decode at all
(first RS=0x07F1=2033 > buffer 1856), so every handle/offset pair we
have is drawn from LZ77-extended zero-padding garbage.  Some of those
pairs happen to land on real object envelopes (1000 "successful"
parses) — but the true HANDLES content for this fixture has not yet
been located in the decompressed stream.  That is the next session's
work: `assemble_r2004_section_full` for sec_num=4 against an AC1024
file where the declared 1856-byte decomp_size doesn't contain a valid
§4.5.2 sub-section header.

---

## 24. Three surgical R2010 parser fixes — §4.6/§4.7 alignment

Applied three fixes to align the R2010 (AC1024) parser with ODA spec:

**Fix 1 — OBJECTS assembly uses `assemble_r2004_section_full` (parser.rs:1243).**
  Per ODA §4.7, LZ77 terminates on its own END opcode and may emit MORE
  bytes than the header's declared `decomp_size`. Truncating at
  `decomp_size` loses the remainder. Using `_full` forces every page's
  allocation to `page_size.max(data_size)` so the decompressor can run
  to END without truncation.

**Fix 2 — parser.rs XOR-header field labels corrected (parser.rs:1867–1878).**
  Per ODA §4.6 the 32-byte XOR-decrypted data-page header has
  `hdr[8..12] = comp_size` and `hdr[12..16] = decomp_size`. `parser.rs`
  previously had these two fields swapped vs `r2007.rs:559-560` which
  was correct. Now both files read the header identically.

**Fix 3 — `try_xor` gate widened to AC1024+ (r2007.rs:500).**
  Per ODA §4.5 the XOR page-header decryption applies to all R2010+
  files (AC1024 and later), not just R2013+. The previous gate
  `version_code >= "AC1027"` excluded R2010 files entirely from the
  XOR-decrypted RS assembler path.

### Results on 3070_model_arceringen_5.dwg (R2010 / AC1024)

| Type       | Baseline | After F1 | After F2 | After F3 | DXF oracle |
|------------|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|-----------:|
| LINE       |     407  |     407  |     407  |     407  |      675   |
| HATCH      |     102  |     102  |     102  |     102  |      169   |
| MTEXT      |      20  |      20  |      20  |      20  |       88   |
| UNKNOWN_0  |     148  |     148  |     148  |     148  |        0   |

Counts did not move. All three fixes are spec-correct per ODA and
build cleanly with no regressions (none worsened the result, all were
kept). The real bottleneck is upstream: `parse_r2004_sections` via
page-walk yields a 267264-byte OBJECTS buffer while the HANDLES map
contains `max_off=370092` — a ~103KB gap. After Fix 3 enables the
r2007 XOR path for AC1024, it still exits early because only the
four system sections (`AcDb:AppInfoHistory`, `AcDb:AppInfo`,
`AcDb:Preview`, `AcDb:RevHistory`, sec_nums 11/10/9/8) are resolved
by name — the AcDb:AcDbObjects and AcDb:Handles sections are not
identified in this file's decrypted section map, so `find_section`
fails and the pipeline returns no results.

### Next session

The ~103KB gap between assembled OBJECTS (267264B) and HANDLES
`max_off` (370092B) implies the page-walk is rejecting or missing
pages. `build_page_map_by_walking` in `parser.rs` should be checked
against the §4.6 header layout (now correct after Fix 2) to see
whether its own header validation used the same swapped fields.
Additionally, the section-map decryption for AC1024 appears to be
short by ~7 section entries (only 4 system sections named vs 11
expected) — likely a per-version offset/stride in the section-map
parser that differs between AC1024 and AC1027+.

## 25. Session 2026-04-20 (follow-up 4) — Hypothesis A/B/C triage; 103KB gap is HANDLES over-decode, not missing pages

### Diagnostic tooling added this session

- `examples/verify_obj_content.rs` — assembles OBJECTS (sec_num=7) identically
  to the main parser and searches for known DXF f64 coords across the whole
  buffer + each decompressed page at every 0..7 bit shift.
- `examples/hunt_4e5.rs` — searches ALL page bodies (any sec_num, 16x
  page_size target) for LINE 0x4E5 coords to test for a hidden data page.
- `examples/handle_locator.rs` — dumps the HANDLES offset distribution,
  focusing on handles past the 267264-byte buffer and inside the gap
  regions of page 13 (0x3A000..0x42000 bit).

### Hypothesis A — missing OBJECTS pages: RULED OUT

Per ODA §4.6 data-page layout, OBJECTS (sec_num=7) comprises 9 pages with
XOR-decrypted headers showing stream-offsets 0x00000, 0x07400, 0x0E800,
0x15C00, 0x1D000, 0x24400, 0x2B800, 0x32C00, 0x3A000. `scan_all_pages`
and `verify_obj_content` confirm these are the ONLY sec_num=7 pages on
disk. Assembled buffer is exactly 9 × page_size = 267264B.

The 103KB gap between buffer (267264B) and HANDLES `max_off` (370092B)
does NOT correspond to on-disk data. Evidence:

1. `hunt_4e5.rs` searches for `LINE 0x4E5` coord `2008.862814420544`
   bit-shifted across every page body, with a 16× page_size (475136B)
   decompression target. Zero hits. The value is not present anywhere
   in the file.
2. `handle_locator.rs` shows 50 handles `0x9EC..0xA1D` mapping to
   offsets 0x40061..0x41F73 (inside OBJECTS buffer, past the real end
   of page 13 content at ~0x3C200), and another 97 handles with
   offsets > 0x42000 (strictly past the buffer).
3. Dumping the 32 bytes at handle 0x9EC's offset 0x40061 yields
   `00 39 00 37 80 38 00 1a 00 18 80 21 80 37 80 36 00 37 80 39 00 24…`
   — NOT a valid MS object-size varint. This is the characteristic
   repeating-pair pattern of HANDLES-section §4.5.2 MC deltas, meaning
   the HANDLES decoder has over-read past its own valid 1856-byte
   region and is emitting handle/offset pairs from LZ77-extended
   wraparound garbage that happens to look like MC pairs.
4. For comparison, handle 0x3BB (known real LINE, offset 0x1C79) has
   content `71 00 27 04 c0 80 ee d4 65 17 80 20 04 60 10 00…` which
   is a plausible MS object-size + entity data.

Conclusion: there is no hidden OBJECTS page. The 147 `offset >
~0x3C200` handles are decode artifacts, not references to missing
entities.

### Hypothesis B — `build_page_map_by_walking` header-field swap: FIXED (latent)

`parser.rs:1762-1763` (pre-fix) read `comp_size` from `hdr[12..16]`.
Per ODA §4.6, `hdr[8..12]` is comp_size and `hdr[12..16]` is
decomp_size. §24 Fix 2 corrected this swap in
`assemble_r2004_section_inner` but missed the same bug in
`build_page_map_by_walking`. Additionally, `offset += comp_size`
ignored the 32-byte XOR header, so the walker stepped inside the
next page's body and desynchronised after 1-2 pages.

Fix at `parser.rs:1763-1790`:
- Read `comp_size` from `hdr[8..12]` (§4.6 layout).
- Advance by `32 + comp_size` aligned to the next 32-byte boundary
  (ODA pages have variable trailing padding; 32-byte alignment is a
  best-effort heuristic since the walker has no access to the
  authoritative `psize` values from the page-map body).

This does NOT improve counts on the fixture (19 → 19 pages recovered
by the walker; the real issue on this fixture is variable 7-87 byte
padding per page which neither heuristic fully captures). The fix is
still spec-correct and reduces the risk of the walker emitting wrong
offsets on other files where the primary pipeline falls through to
this fallback.

### Hypothesis C — section map decrypt incomplete: CONFIRMED ROOT CAUSE

The decrypted section map for this AC1024 fixture is 530 bytes and
begins with preamble byte pattern:
```
0C 00 00 00 02 00 00 00 00 74 00 00 …
```
per ODA §4.6 preamble: `RL total_section_count` then `RL ?`. If
`hdr_a = 0x0C = 12` is a genuine section count, then 12 sections
should be listed. Our `parse_section_map_r2010` only finds 4 (the
metadata sections AppInfoHistory, AppInfo, Preview, RevHistory).

The other 8 sections (Header, Handles, Classes, AcDbObjects,
AuxHeader, Template, ObjFreeSpace, SummaryInfo) are not in the
decrypted bytes at all — after the 4 named entries ending at
offset 0x200 the remaining 0x012 bytes are pure zero padding.

This means either:
1. The 530-byte decompression is **short** (the real section map is
   bigger) — there may be a second section-map page, or the
   decompression stops prematurely because the LZ77 target size
   (530 bytes) is wrong, or
2. AC1024 files genuinely embed only 4 sections in the named map,
   and the 8 data sections' page lists live elsewhere (§4.5
   "System sections map" addr at header offset 0x60, which this
   parser does NOT currently read).

ODA §4.6 says the section-map ALWAYS includes all sections. So case
(1) is more likely. `read_section_map_by_page` in `r2007.rs:661`
decompresses with `dwg_parser::parser::decompress_r2004` targeting
`data_size` from the system-page header. If that header under-
reports the decomp target (as we saw for data pages in §21), LZ77
would produce 530 bytes and stop, even though the true output is
larger.

This is the next session's target: audit `read_section_map_by_page`
to decompress with an oversized target (e.g. `max(data_size, 4 *
comp_size, page_size)`) and re-run `parse_section_map_r2010`.

### Files changed this session

- `parser.rs:1762-1790` — `build_page_map_by_walking`: read `comp_size`
  from `hdr[8..12]` per §4.6 (was `hdr[12..16]`), advance by
  `align32(32 + comp_size)` (was `comp_size` alone).

### Before / after on fixture

| Metric               | Before | After |
|----------------------|--------|-------|
| LINE                 | 407    | 407   |
| HATCH                | 102    | 102   |
| MTEXT                | 20     | 20    |
| UNKNOWN_0            | 148    | 148   |
| Pages found by walker| 19     | 19    |
| Regression?          | —      | none  |

Counts did not move because the primary R2010-RS pipeline handles
this fixture without falling through to `build_page_map_by_walking`.
Fix is a latent correctness improvement for files where the primary
pipeline fails.

### Residuals (next-session handles)

1. **Hypothesis C — section map under-decompression**: audit
   `r2007.rs:661 read_section_map_by_page` to use a larger LZ77
   target. If the section map decompresses to > 530 bytes, the
   additional entries should name Header, Handles, Classes,
   AcDbObjects with their explicit page lists. That would replace
   the current `probe_sections` heuristic (which is upstream of the
   HANDLES over-decode issue).

2. **HANDLES CRC-per-sub-section validation**: per ODA §4.5.2, each
   HANDLES sub-section ends in a 2-byte CRC. A CRC check at the end
   of each sub-section would cleanly terminate decoding at the first
   invalid sub-section, dropping all 147 bogus offset >= 0x3C200
   entries and eliminating the "OOB" + "Zero object size" failure
   cohort without affecting real entities.

3. The 148 `UNKNOWN_0` objects and ~40 other `UNKNOWN_*` counts are
   orthogonal: §22 verified these are HANDLES over-decode artifacts
   that land in zero-pad regions of the OBJECTS buffer, not
   legitimately-mappable entities. Resolving (2) makes them go away.

## 26. Oversize section-map LZ77 target (decoded all 11 named entries)

Per §25 the direct-page section-map decode returned 530 bytes of which
only 4 of 12 entries were named. The smoking gun was
`r2007.rs:661 read_section_map_by_page` calling `decompress_r2004(body,
data_size)` with the declared `data_size = 530` — per ODA §4.7 LZ77
terminates on opcode `0x11` (END); if the target buffer is smaller than
the natural emitted length the loop breaks on `di >= decompressed_size`
before hitting END, truncating the stream.

**Fix (parser.rs + r2007.rs)**:

1. `decompress_r2004` refactored into `decompress_r2004_core` returning
   `(Vec<u8>, usize_actually_written)`. Old `decompress_r2004` keeps its
   contract (pads/truncates to `decompressed_size`). New helper
   `decompress_r2004_generous(src, ceiling)` allocates an oversized
   target and returns only the `di` prefix that was really emitted.

2. `read_section_map_by_page` now calls `decompress_r2004_generous` with
   `ceiling = max(data_size, 4*body_size, 16*body_size, 0x4000)` (also
   for the XOR-decrypted data-page branch). The declared `data_size` is
   no longer used as the ceiling during decompression, only for legacy
   callers.

3. `parse_section_map_r2010` (parser.rs:2277) previously synthesized
   `section_type = section_number` for R2010+ entries. The downstream
   `section_ids` HashMap keys on the legacy R2004 type hashes
   (`SECTION_TYPE_HEADER = 0x4163003B`, etc.), so no lookup matched.
   Now `parse_section_map_r2010` maps well-known `AcDb:*` names back to
   those hashes so `section_ids.get(&SECTION_TYPE_HEADER)` resolves.

4. `assemble_r2004_section_inner` now uses `decompress_r2004_generous`
   with a generous per-page ceiling when `force_full_page` is set, so
   under-reported `data_size` on OBJECTS/HANDLES/CLASSES pages no
   longer truncates the decompressor.

**Measured effect on the fixture (3070_model .. _5.dwg)**:

| Metric | Before (§25) | After (§26) |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Section-map decompressed bytes | 530 | **1476** |
| Named `AcDb:*` sections | 4 | **11** |
| RS pipeline objects_section | 0 (fell through) | 267264 |
| RS pipeline objects parsed | 0 | **1000 direct** |
| Final objects parsed | 1000 (via fallback) | 1000 |
| LINE / HATCH / MTEXT / UNKNOWN_0 | 407 / 102 / 20 / 148 | 407 / 102 / 20 / 148 |

Section-map now correctly lists
`AppInfoHistory, AppInfo, Preview, RevHistory, AcDbObjects,
ObjFreeSpace, Template, Handles, Classes, AuxHeader, Header` — i.e.
all 6 core sections (`Header`, `Classes`, `ObjFreeSpace`, `Template`,
`Handles`, `AcDbObjects`) plus 5 auxiliary ones. The 12th header-count
entry is missing from the decompressed output; likely `FileDepList` or
`SummaryInfo` which are not present in this fixture.

**Why counts did not change**: the RS pipeline is now reaching the
SAME outcome as the previous fallback `probe_sections` + page-walk
heuristic — `sec_num=7` as OBJECTS (9 pages, 267264B assembled). So
the section-map fix is a structural win (replaces a heuristic with a
spec-driven lookup) but does not by itself unlock new content.

**The real bottleneck is elsewhere** (to address in §27):

- `object_map offset range: 4..370092` — HANDLES decoder claims 1136
  handles whose offsets reach `0x5A56C`, but the assembled OBJECTS
  section is only `0x41400 = 267264` bytes. 115/1136 offsets (10 %)
  are OOB past the section end. The section-map unambiguously reports
  `AcDbObjects: num_pages=9, data_size=0x7400` — so the OBJECTS
  section IS 267 KB. Either:
  (a) HANDLES is over-decoding (per §25 hypothesis: the ldelta MC is
      overflowing into a next sub-section / CRC bytes and producing
      bogus offsets), confirmed: 148 `UNKNOWN_0` objects land in
      zero-pad regions of the assembled OBJECTS buffer — exactly the
      artefact §22 described.
  (b) OBJECTS has more pages than listed in the page_map (pages 20, 21
      appear unused in the page_map, though the file extends to them).

- DXF oracle has 675 LINE / 169 HATCH / 88 MTEXT. Our 407/102/20 means
  ~40 % of entities are still missing. Those missing handles are
  within the first 1000 but decode into UNKNOWN/garbage, meaning the
  OBJECTS section assembly or the per-object parser is desynced.

**Next actionable step (§27 candidates)**:

1. Walk page_map pages NOT claimed by any section — pages 20, 21 are
   unaccounted for. If either is encrypted-sec_num=7, adding them to
   the OBJECTS assembly lifts the section size from 267264 → ~370092
   and matches the handle-offset range.

2. Implement the HANDLES sub-section CRC check per ODA §4.5.2 to
   cleanly terminate object-map decoding at the first bad sub-section
   and drop the 147 bogus offsets that produce UNKNOWN_0 artefacts.

## 27. Pages 20/21 hypothesis — FALSIFIED; HANDLES over-decode is the real bottleneck

Per §26 residual (1), the hypothesis was that pages 20 and 21 exist
on disk but are not claimed by any section, and that attaching them
to the OBJECTS assembly would close the 267264 → 370092 gap. This
session tested the hypothesis directly.

### Step 1 — dump_page_map + scan_all_pages

Running the existing diagnostics against the fixture
(`3070_model - Legend - M(--)01_arceringen_5.dwg`, AC1024) shows the
page-map body has exactly **21 entries** with page_num sequence
`1..=19, 22, 23` — page numbers **20 and 21 are absent**. Per ODA §4.6
the map is a flat `(page_num, psize)` list; there are no synthetic
"gap" entries with negative psize for 20/21.

The file-header summary at hdr[0x40]=21 confirms total page count 21,
and hdr[0x50]=23 confirms max page-num 23. The file ends at byte
0x22330 (140026 B on disk); page 23 at file_off=0x221C0 + psize
0x620 closes the file exactly. Between the end of page 19's body
(file_off 0x021BC0 + 32 + comp_size 902 = 0x021F5A) and the start of
page 22 (0x021F80) there are only 38 bytes of inter-page padding —
far too small to hold the claimed 103 KB.

### Step 2 — plaintext oracle

`plaintext_search` was re-run and confirms **LINE 0x4E5** f64
start.x `2008.862814420544` is absent from the raw file AND from
every decompressed page body at every 0..7 bit shift (matching the
§25 result). Per the task's stop condition, if the target coord is
not found in pages 20/21, they are "something else (maybe
ObjFreeSpace, maybe padding). Report + stop." Since pages 20/21 do
not exist, the conclusion is stronger: there is no hidden data page
on disk, and LINE 0x4E5's coord is not present anywhere in the file.

### Root cause reaffirmation

The 103 KB apparent gap is a HANDLES-section over-decode, NOT
missing pages (per §25 Hypothesis C + §22). `parse_objects` prints
`32/1136 map offsets -> zeros, 115/1136 offsets OOB (>267264),
max_off=370092`. Exactly 147 handles (13 % of 1136) are garbage
emitted after the first valid HANDLES sub-section ends.

### No code changed this session

Counts are unchanged — the hypothesis was falsified by diagnostic
data before any code was modified, per clean-room rule "if counts
regress, revert". Baseline LINE 407 / HATCH 102 / MTEXT 20 /
UNKNOWN_0 148 remain the starting point for §28.

### §28 candidates (unchanged from §25/§26 residual 2)

1. **HANDLES sub-section CRC-16 (ODA §4.5.2)**: each sub-section ends
   in a 2-byte CRC. Validating it per-sub-section would cleanly
   terminate the decoder at the first bad sub-section and drop all
   147 bogus offsets (zeros + OOB) in one shot. This is the only path
   remaining to lift UNKNOWN_0 148 → 0 and reclaim the handles whose
   real offsets fall inside the valid 267264 B buffer but whose
   decoder-desync lands them past the end.

2. **DXF oracle gap (675 LINE vs 407)**: the DXF twin enumerates 675
   LINEs but the DWG fixture's HANDLES section only lists 1136 total
   object handles. With ~989 legitimate handles (1136 − 147 bogus),
   the arithmetic supports at most ~700 real entities of all classes.
   The DXF oracle's 675 LINE + 169 HATCH + 88 MTEXT = 932 assumes a
   DWG → DXF expansion (MInsertBlocks, nested BLOCK references, etc.)
   that multiplies visible entities beyond the raw handle count.
   Matching DXF counts 1:1 is likely not achievable without BLOCK
   expansion in the DWG consumer — orthogonal to the parser.

## 29. HANDLES sub-section delta reset — ROOT CAUSE CRACKED

Per ODA *Open Design Specification for .dwg files* §26.5 the HANDLES
section is a sequence of sub-sections, each of the form:

```
RS size (big-endian, includes CRC bytes in count)
( hdelta: unsigned MC, ldelta: signed MC ) * N
RS crc16
```

**Clarification not previously captured in our notes**: each
sub-section's delta stream is **INDEPENDENT**. `last_handle` and
`last_loc` MUST reset to 0 at the start of every sub-section. The
first entry's `hdelta` is therefore the ABSOLUTE handle value (not a
delta from the previous sub-section's last).

### Known-plaintext oracle (clean-room — DXF twin, no external DWG tools)

Evidence gathered on `2705_model Funderingsherstel - CP-21.dwg`:

- `$HANDSEED = 0x165A` (from DXF header) — the next handle to allocate,
  so the max live handle is `< 0x165A`.
- DXF group-5 handles (incl. 330/340/350/360 references): 3428 unique,
  max `0x165A`, min `0x1`.
- Our parser with the OLD accumulating-across-sub-sections behaviour
  produced 3423 entries with `max = 0x51C1 = 20929` (3.65× too large).
- The first entry of each sub-section had a very large `hdelta`
  (869, 1631, 3176, 4231, 5309). Interpreting these as absolute
  handle values yields: `0x365, 0x65F, 0xC68, 0x1087, 0x14BD` — all
  within the DXF handle space (below `0x165A`). Interpreting them as
  deltas-from-previous yields `0x6C9, 0x1021, 0x228E, 0x3733, 0x5025`
  — ALL outside the DXF handle space.

| handle at sub-sec start | "absolute" (reset) | "cumulative" (old) | in DXF? |
|-------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------|
| sec 2                   | 0x365              | 0x6C9              | reset: yes; cumul: **no** |
| sec 3                   | 0x65F              | 0x1021             | reset: yes; cumul: **no** |
| sec 4                   | 0xC68              | 0x228E             | reset: yes*; cumul: **no** |
| sec 5                   | 0x1087             | 0x3733             | reset: yes; cumul: **no** |
| sec 6                   | 0x14BD             | 0x5025             | reset: yes; cumul: **no** |

\*0xC68 itself is not in the DXF handle set but is within the live
range `0x1..0x165A` — a handle may exist in the map without appearing
as a group-5 or owner-ref code in DXF export.

### Fix (clean-room, from spec text only)

`parser.rs:709-725` (new `parse_object_map_r2004`) and
`parser.rs:611-619` (`parse_object_map_r2000`):

```rust
// per ODA §26.5 / §29: each HANDLES sub-section has an INDEPENDENT
// delta stream — reset state at every sub-section boundary.
last_handle = 0;
last_loc = 0;
```

### Before / after entity counts

| File | Metric | Before (§28) | After (§29) | DXF oracle |
|------|--------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| arceringen | Objects parsed | 1000 | **1136** | — |
| arceringen | LINE | 407 | **675** | 675 |
| arceringen | HATCH | 102 | **169** | 169 |
| arceringen | MTEXT | 20 | **88** | 88 |
| arceringen | INSERT | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| arceringen | UNKNOWN_0 | 148 | 0 | — |
| Funderingsherstel | Objects parsed | 1541 | **3423** | 3422 unique |
| Funderingsherstel | LINE | 413 | **1651** | 965 native / 15717 expanded |
| Funderingsherstel | CIRCLE | 7 | **207** | 2142 expanded |
| Funderingsherstel | ARC | 34 | **73** | 1743 expanded |
| Funderingsherstel | INSERT | 37 | **165** | 1149 (many blocks not expanded) |
| Funderingsherstel | HATCH | 20 | **85** | 46 |
| Funderingsherstel | MTEXT | 1 | **501** | — |

`arceringen` now matches DXF exactly on LINE/HATCH/MTEXT (1:1 oracle
match). `Funderingsherstel` parses all 3423 HANDLES-listed objects
correctly; the DXF's larger counts (15717 LINE, 1149 INSERT) reflect
BLOCK expansion during DWG→DXF save where every INSERT is flattened
to the primitives inside its BLOCK — this is a property of the DXF
writer, not of the DWG parser (the raw DWG store is 1651 LINEs +
165 INSERTs referencing BLOCK definitions).

### Residuals — next session candidates

1. The 384 non-entity objects on Funderingsherstel contain 158
   `UNKNOWN_0` and 64 `UNKNOWN_*` counts — these are legitimate object
   classes whose parser is not yet implemented (LAYER, BLOCK_HEADER,
   LTYPE, etc. all parse correctly; the `UNKNOWN_*` ones map to
   custom/proxy classes in the `AcDb:Classes` section).
2. INSERT counts (165 vs 1149 DXF) — the DWG stores each INSERT once;
   DXF expansion multiplies them by the contained entity count. To
   reach DXF parity the consumer must walk `BLOCK_HEADER.entities` for
   each referenced BLOCK. Orthogonal to the parser.
3. `arceringen` total objects went from 1000 to 1136 (+136 objects that
   were previously in `UNKNOWN_0` from the over-accumulated decoder).

### Files changed

- `parser.rs:611-619` — `parse_object_map_r2000`: reset
  `last_handle = 0; last_loc = 0` at each sub-section.
- `parser.rs:709-725` — `parse_object_map_r2004`: same reset, with
  citation + evidence in the comment.

## §30 — HATCH pattern-line emission (non-solid fills)

**Problem.** `parser.rs::parse_hatch` (R2010 HATCH body, per ODA
§19.4.96) already READ the pattern-line fields (angle BD, base 2RD,
offset 2RD, num_dashes BS, dashes BD[]) solely to advance the bit
stream, then discarded the values. Consequence: every non-solid DWG
HATCH (isolatie, metselwerk, grind, kruisarcering, …) hit the scene-io
HATCH arm with `solidFill=false` but NO pattern definition, so the
renderer fell through to boundary-outline-only. Legend sheets that
rendered richly from the DXF twin rendered as empty rectangles from
DWG.

**Fix — parser side.** `parse_hatch` now accumulates each pattern
definition line into a JSON object of shape

```json
{
  "angle":  <f64 degrees>,
  "base":   { "x": <f64>, "y": <f64> },
  "offset": { "x": <f64>, "y": <f64> },
  "dashes": [<f64>, ...]     // DXF code-49 semantics: + = pen-down, − = pen-up
}
```

and attaches the array under key `"patternLines"` on the HATCH map.
Existing keys `"patternAngle"` / `"patternScale"` (the HATCH-level
overall rotation/scale — DXF codes 52 / 41) are still emitted unchanged.

**Fix — consumer side.** `scene_io.rs::tessellate_one` HATCH arm now
builds a `Vec<HatchPatternLine>` from `d["patternLines"]` once per
HATCH, then calls `emit_hatch_pattern_lines` for every boundary ring
(both polyline-vertex and edge-path branches) when `is_solid` is false
and the pattern-line vec is non-empty. The `emit_hatch_pattern_lines`
path is shared with the DXF loader (see §1660 for the DXF call-site)
so dash phase, ring-clip, and parallel-family generation stay
identical across the two formats.

**Verification.** `arceringen test/3070_model … _5.{dxf,dwg}`:

| format | entities | HATCH | total segments |
|--------|---------:|------:|---------------:|
| DXF    |        — |   164 |        192,903 |
| DWG    |     1136 |   169 |        203,302 |

Pre-fix the DWG number was in the low-thousands range (boundary
outlines only). Segment counts in the same order of magnitude as DXF
confirm the pattern-line fill now emits for both loaders. LN=675 stays
untouched (LINE arm unaffected).

### Residuals

1. `patternScale` / `patternAngle` (HATCH-level post-rotation/scale —
   DXF codes 41/52) are emitted into the JSON but NOT currently
   applied by `emit_hatch_pattern_lines`; the DXF loader already has
   this gap too. For the canonical training-set HATCHes scale=1, angle=0 in
   practice (the per-pattern-line `angle`/`offset` already encodes
   everything), so the visual output matches DXF one-to-one. When a
   file appears where the hatch-level scale differs from 1, offsets
   and dashes need a uniform multiply before the call.
2. Spline HATCH boundaries (edge_type=4) are still not polygonized in
   the edge-ring branch — the parser pushes a `{"type":"spline", …}`
   edge object that the scene_io `match etype` arm silently ignores.
   Unaffected by this change (same as DXF pre-fix).
3. A small subset of DWG hatches on the arceringen sheet render as
   outline-only where the DXF twin shows a solid red fill — this is a
   separate `solidFill` flag decode mismatch, not a pattern-line
   issue, and is orthogonal to §30.

### Files changed

- `src/parser.rs` (`parse_hatch`, lines ~6420-6459) — replace
  discard loop with JSON accumulator, insert `"patternLines"`.
- Consumer-side (renderer): HATCH arm parses `patternLines` →
  `Vec<HatchPatternLine>` once per hatch and routes solid vs pattern
  fills through `emit_hatch_pattern_lines` for non-solid hatches and
  edge-ring branches after arc/line tessellation.

## §31 — HATCH pattern-line decode correction (angle units + base/offset type)

**Problem.** The §30 pattern-line emission decoded the per-line record
as `angle (BD, degrees)`, `pt0 (2RD)`, `offset (2RD)`. Two bugs:

1. **Angle units** — ODA §19.4.96 specifies the per-pattern-line angle
   as a `BD` in **radians** (consistent with every other BD angle in
   the DWG format), not degrees. The JSON field `"angle"` is consumed
   by `scene_io::HatchPatternLine.angle_deg` which calls
   `.to_radians()` on it. Writing radians-into-a-"degrees" field made
   45° (π/4 rad) render as 0.0137° — all DWG pattern hatches drew as
   near-horizontal lines instead of the intended diagonals / verticals.
2. **Point type** — `pt0` and `offset` are **2BD** (two bit-doubles),
   not 2RD. Reading 128 raw-double bits where 2×BD was expected
   consumed too many bits and immediately drifted the stream. Side
   effects: (a) the very first pattern-line's origin/offset decoded to
   garbage magnitudes (1e-271 … 1e+247); (b) any hatch with ≥2
   pattern-lines had every subsequent line scrambled; (c) the DWG
   HATCH area then usually drew only the boundary outline plus a few
   pathological pattern lines.

**Evidence.** Test fixture `arceringen test/3070_model … _5.{dxf,dwg}`,
same HATCH entity by handle (DXF-handle 0xCF → DWG h=204, pattern
`FP_1`):

|                        | DXF (oracle)                       | DWG (post-fix)                     |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| pattern-line[0] angle  | 45.0°                              | 45.0° (0.7854 rad × 180/π)         |
| pattern-line[0] base   | (0.0, 0.0)                         | (0.0, 0.0)                         |
| pattern-line[0] offset | (-35.92102448427662, 35.9210…)     | (-35.921024484276614, 35.9210…)    |
| pattern-line[1] angle  | 45.0°                              | 45.0°                              |
| pattern-line[1] base   | (10.16, 0.0)                       | (10.16, 0.0)                       |
| pattern-line[1] offset | (-35.9210…, 35.9210…)              | (-35.9210…, 35.9210…)              |

15-digit agreement on the per-line record. Same agreement verified on
FP_2 (135°), FP_5 (8 pattern lines, mix of 90°/180°), and several
multi-line brick/wood patterns.

**Fix.** `src/parser.rs`, `parse_hatch` pattern-line loop:
- `read_bd()` → store as `angle.to_degrees()` in JSON.
- `read_2rd()` → `read_2bd()` for both `pt0` and `offset`.

The consumer side (`scene_io.rs` HatchPatternLine) is **unchanged**.

**Verification.** `arceringen test` fixture:

| format | HATCH | segments (pre §31) | segments (post §31) |
|--------|------:|-------------------:|--------------------:|
| DXF    |   164 |            192,903 |             192,903 |
| DWG    |   169 |            203,302 |             214,485 |

Visual: side-by-side headless render of the legend sheet shows DWG and
DXF hatches now match cell-by-cell across the ~90 pattern samples
(grind, isolatie, metselwerk, brick, wood, kruisarcering at 45°/135°,
verticals at 90°, etc.).

### Residuals (unchanged from §30)

1. `patternScale` / `patternAngle` (DXF codes 41/52) still not applied
   in `emit_hatch_pattern_lines`; both fixtures have scale=1 angle=0
   so this is latent.
2. Spline boundaries (edge_type=4) still not polygonized.
3. Solid-fill flag decode mismatch on a small subset of hatches
   (outline only where DXF has solid red) — orthogonal to §30/§31.

### Files changed

- `src/parser.rs` (`parse_hatch` pattern-line loop, lines ~6440-6466) —
  `angle_rad.to_degrees()` and `read_2bd` for base/offset.

## Session 2026-05-05 — DIMSTYLE TV chain over-read + annotative scale

### Symptom
DIMENSION arrows/ticks visibly wrong in DWG side of split_compare vs DXF
oracle. Diagnostic dump (`O2D_DWG_DIM_DUMP=1`) showed `dimblk2` field for
"1_8_mm_0_" and similar dimstyles populated with garbage Unicode (e.g.
`"Ȩᒂ\u{e484}ꁂ\u{e4a4}..."` ~233 chars). Expected: empty string (since
DIMBLK1/DIMBLK2 are stored as handle refs in R2000+, group codes 343/344
in DXF, not strings).

### Root cause — `parse_dimstyle_obj` over-reading TV chain (per ODA §20.4.40)
Per ODA OpenDesignSpec §20.4.40 (DIMSTYLE Object body, R2000+), the only
TVs in the dimstyle body are DIMPOST and DIMAPOST. DIMBLK, DIMBLK1, and
DIMBLK2 became HANDLE references stored in the trailing handle-stream
(group codes 340/343/344 in DXF), NOT TV strings. The previous
implementation read 5 consecutive TVs (DIMPOST, DIMAPOST, DIMBLK,
DIMBLK1, DIMBLK2) which over-ran the per-record string stream and
returned bytes from the next dimstyle's strings as "dimblk2".

### Fix — drop the three obsolete TV reads
`parser.rs::parse_dimstyle_obj` — keep DIMPOST + DIMAPOST TV reads
(handle-stream-managed, no main-stream cost on R2007+) and drop the
three obsolete TV reads. `dimblk1`/`dimblk2` now default to empty
strings; renderer falls through to default arrowhead glyph (correct
behaviour when no override block is named).

### Renderer side — annotation scale from DIMSTYLE name (scene_io.rs)
`scene_io.rs` previously hardcoded a 100× multiplier when DIMSCALE looked
annotative (=1.0) and DIMTXT was paper-size (≤10 mm). For drawings using
"1_8_mm_0_" (1/8" = 1' = 1:96 architectural) this produced text/arrows
~4% too small. Replaced the hardcode with a name-based parser:
  - `"1_N_mm"` with N ∈ {2,4,8,16,32} → imperial 12·N (1:96 etc.)
  - `"M_N_mm"` otherwise → metric N/M ratio (1:50, 1:100, etc.)
  - falls back to 100× when the name doesn't match the convention

The DXF oracle bakes the same scale into DIMSCALE/DIMTXT directly (DXF
1_8_mm_0_ has DIMSCALE=304.8 = 25.4·12, DIMTXT=101.49 = 2.5·40.6) so the
two pipelines now agree on text and arrow size.

### Findings still open (logged for next round)
- Raw DIMSCALE/DIMTXT/DIMASZ from `parse_dimstyle_obj` BD chain remain
  subnormal garbage on R2007+ — bit-stream offset is mis-aligned by
  ~148 bits before the BD chain (verified by scan: known-value 0.295
  appears at +148 from current BD-start position; first `read_bd`
  consistently returns subnormal). The 6×BS preamble after the bit-flag
  block is likely missing one or more R2007+-specific BS/RC fields per
  ODA §20.4.40. Workaround: the parser's sanity-clamp substitutes
  AutoCAD defaults (DIMSCALE=1.0, DIMTXT=2.5, DIMASZ=2.5), and the
  name-based annotation-scale heuristic above multiplies up to the
  correct on-paper size for the common 3bm dimstyle naming convention.
  Real fix: locate the missing R2007+ DIMSTYLE bit-stream fields
  between the 6×BS group and the DIMSCALE BD per ODA spec.
- DIMBLK1/DIMBLK2 are now empty even when the dimstyle uses non-default
  arrowheads (e.g. `_OBLIQUE`). Resolving them requires walking the
  trailing handle stream of the DIMSTYLE object to look up the
  BLOCK_RECORD entries at handle positions 343/344 — out of scope for
  this round.

### Files changed
- `src/parser.rs` (`parse_dimstyle_obj`) — drop 3 obsolete
  TV reads; default dimblk1/dimblk2 to empty per §20.4.40.
- Consumer-side (renderer): `DimStyleInfo` gains `name`
  field; DIMENSION text-render uses name-based annotation scale.

## Session 2026-05-05 — Cleanup pass (no behaviour changes)

Atomic refactor pass over the parser crate. Each commit verified
byte-identical stdout (sans `parse time:`, sorted to neutralise
HashMap iteration order) on the four canonical fixtures: `pair.dwg`,
`circle_2010.dwg`, `line_2010.dwg`, `arc_2010.dwg`. Verification
harness lives at `.verify.sh` in the crate root (gitignored —
local-only because the baseline md5s are captured per-machine).

### Findings still open (carried forward)

- **`best_object_map` lost between pipelines.** The R2010+ retry path
  in `parse_r2018` keeps the `best_objects` Vec from whichever
  pipeline parsed the most objects, but the corresponding
  `best_object_map` is taken from `dwg.object_map` only for the
  side-effect of clearing the slot — never restored. If the *first*
  pipeline produces the best object set but a *later* pipeline runs
  (and clears the map), downstream code that reads `dwg.object_map`
  for handle→offset lookups loses the link. Currently masked because
  the RS pipeline almost always produces the best result on the first
  try and we early-return. See parser.rs SPEC NOTE around L2886 /
  L2910.

- **`_data_size` in `parse_section_map_r2018`** (r2007.rs L1044). The
  RLL header field is read but never used as a bound on the per-page
  data slice — the loop strides by `pe_size` instead. Adding a
  bound-check candidate for the next round.

- **XOR-decrypted page-header fallback (r2007.rs L223).**
  Re-introduction gated to AC1032 only after the previous attempt
  produced 2-of-2³² mask collisions; tracked here so the next
  AC1032 fixture triage finds the breadcrumb.

- (Carried from §DIMSTYLE 2026-05-05) raw DIMSCALE/DIMTXT/DIMASZ on
  R2007+ remain mis-aligned by ~148 bits; sanity-clamp + name-based
  annotation scale workaround in place.

- (Carried from §DIMSTYLE 2026-05-05) DIMBLK1/DIMBLK2 are now empty
  even for non-default arrowheads (e.g. `_OBLIQUE`). Resolution
  requires walking the trailing handle stream at positions 343/344.
