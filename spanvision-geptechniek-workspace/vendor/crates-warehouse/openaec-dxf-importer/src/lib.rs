//! # openaec-dxf-importer
//!
//! Generic, sink-driven importer for the Autodesk DXF (Drawing Exchange
//! Format) text and binary streams.
//!
//! The crate parses a DXF file via the public `dxf` crate, then walks
//! the entity list and converts each entity into one or more
//! tessellated primitives (line segments, triangles, text anchors)
//! that it emits through a user-supplied [`DxfSink`] trait. This lets
//! the same importer feed any consumer:
//!
//! - a 2D Canvas / GPU viewer (Open 2D Studio)
//! - an SVG writer
//! - an IFC bridge
//! - a unit-test harness counting entities
//!
//! ## Provenance
//!
//! The tessellation logic was extracted from the
//! [open-2d-studio](https://github.com/OpenAEC-Foundation/open-2d-studio)
//! `scene_io::load_dxf` pipeline. DXF itself is a public Autodesk
//! interchange format documented in the *AutoCAD DXF Reference* PDF;
//! the implementation is original code written from that reference.
//!
//! ## v0.1 scope
//!
//! Currently wired:
//! - [`LINE`](entities::line)
//! - [`CIRCLE`](entities::circle)
//! - [`ARC`](entities::arc)
//! - [`LWPOLYLINE`](entities::polyline) (incl. per-vertex bulges → arc segments)
//! - [`POLYLINE`](entities::polyline) (legacy 2D, incl. bulges)
//!
//! Deferred to v0.2 (stub branches emit a `tracing::warn!` so the consumer
//! can see what was skipped):
//! - `ELLIPSE`, `SPLINE` (parametric curves)
//! - `INSERT` (block expansion + transform stack)
//! - `HATCH` (pattern + boundary tessellation)
//! - `TEXT`, `MTEXT` (glyph outlines / Hershey fallback)
//! - `DIMENSION` (all subtypes — needs DIMSTYLE table parsing)
//! - `SOLID`, `3DFACE` (filled quads/tris)
//!

/// Consumer-supplied output trait for the tessellated DXF stream.
///
/// The importer calls these methods as it walks the parsed DXF
/// drawing. Implementations decide where the emitted geometry goes —
/// a GPU buffer, an SVG file, a database row, an entity count.
///
/// Implementations must be cheap to call: a typical sheet emits tens
/// of thousands of segments per second. Buffer / batch on your side if
/// you need throughput.
///
/// ### Coordinates
/// All emitted coordinates are in **DXF world units** (millimetres,
/// metres, inches — whatever the source file's `$INSUNITS` says; the
/// importer does not normalise). The y-axis is **cartesian positive
/// up** (DXF native; flip on the consumer side if you target a screen
/// space with y-down).
///
/// ### Colour
/// `color_argb` is a 32-bit ARGB value with `0xFF` alpha for opaque,
/// resolved from the entity's true-color override (if any), its ACI
/// index, or its layer's ACI. Consumers should NOT re-do the
/// BYLAYER/BYBLOCK fallback chain; it's already done.
///
/// ### Layer indexing
/// Layer identifiers are passed as small `u16` indices. The importer
/// allocates them on first sight via [`DxfSink::add_layer`] — the
/// sink decides what `u16` to hand back, but the same `name` MUST
/// always map to the same index.

    /// - `layer_idx` — index returned by an earlier [`add_layer`](Self::add_layer) call.
    /// - `entity_idx` — opaque, monotonically increasing per source
    ///   entity. Sink implementations may use it to group segments
    ///   that belong to the same source entity (selection, hover).
    /// - `dash_kind` — `0 = solid`, `1 = dashed`, `2 = dotted`,
    ///   `3 = dash-dot`. Solid is the safe default if the importer
    ///   couldn't classify the linetype.
