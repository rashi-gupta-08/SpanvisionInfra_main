//! Per-entity tessellators.
//!
//! Each submodule handles a single DXF entity type. Functions take the
//! parsed `dxf` entity, a per-entity emission context (colour, layer
//! index, entity index, dash kind, linetype), and a mutable `DxfSink`
//! into which they push tessellated primitives.
//!
//! v0.1 wires `LINE`, `CIRCLE`, `ARC`, and the two polyline variants.
//! Other variants live as `pub(crate) fn warn_*` stubs in `walker.rs`
//! so the wiring point stays the entity-type `match` in `walker.rs`.
