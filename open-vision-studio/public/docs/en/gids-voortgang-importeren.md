# Importing progress

A site foreman usually doesn't work in Open Vision Studio itself. Send them a spreadsheet, let them
fill in what's already done, and read the returned sheet back in — without having to rebuild your
project. That's what this feature does: it **updates existing tasks**, it never creates new ones.

## What you'll learn here

- Why you set a status date first, before reading a sheet back in.
- How to export the sheet, and what the `OPS Task ID` column does.
- What is locked down in the Excel sheet, and why.
- Where to find the feature.
- Which three columns are read, and which two are only used as a check.
- That completion is always a percentage.
- Which date formats work, and what happens when the app isn't sure.
- What an empty field means.
- How linking works, and how to link a row by hand.
- Why new rows in the sheet don't become new tasks.
- Which rows get refused, and why.
- That the preview is mandatory and that you can't switch documents during the import.
- That you need to recalculate afterwards.

## Set a status date first

Before reading a returned sheet, set a **status date** on the Planning tab (your project's reference
date). Without a status date the app cannot judge whether a reported actual date lies in the future —
and that check is exactly the protection against a typo in a returned sheet (for example an actual
start accidentally entered as next month). How to set the status date, and what else it does, is
covered in the [Baselines & progress](docs://gids-baselines-voortgang) guide.

Forgot? If you read a sheet in while no status date is set, the app sets it to today — just like when
you enter progress in the panel or the Table view — and tells you so at the bottom of the screen. A
single **Undo** (Ctrl+Z) reverts the sheet and the status date together. An actual date later than
today is rejected in that case.

## Exporting the sheet

The fastest route is the **Export progress sheet** button on the Planning, Table or Report tab, in the
Progress group. That button produces an **Excel workbook** (`.xlsx`) with exactly the columns a foreman
needs: task id, WBS, name, Start, Finish, Completion (%), Actual Start and Actual Finish — nothing
else. The file is named `<project name>-voortgang.xlsx` and lands in your downloads folder wherever
possible. This is the recommended route: fewer columns to accidentally change, and nothing for the
foreman to ignore. The column headers themselves say what's expected too — for example
"Completion (%) — fill in: 0 to 100" or "WBS — do not change".

### What is locked down in the Excel sheet

- **Only the three fill-in columns can be edited**: Completion (%), Actual Start and Actual Finish.
  The rest of the sheet is locked — typing in the WBS or Name column is simply refused by your
  spreadsheet program. There is no password on it: this is a handrail against a slip, not a lock
  against intent.
- **The columns have a usable width**, so names and dates are readable straight away without dragging
  column borders first.
- **Dates are real date cells** and the percentage is a real number cell. So fill in an actual date as
  a date — with the date picker, or simply typed — and not as loose text.
- **The fill-in columns check what you type.** A percentage must be between 0 and 100 and may have
  decimals (`33.4` is fine); a date must be a valid date. Type `150` in the percentage column and your
  spreadsheet program says so right away.
- **Summary tasks are not filled in.** Their three fill-in cells carry the text "— summary task: do
  not fill in"; just leave that text in place.

Prefer plain text? The same slim sheet still exists as a CSV, with exactly the same columns:
Backstage → Export → **Progress sheet (CSV)**. Handy when the sheet has to go through a script, an ERP
import or a word processor afterwards. Everything below applies to both sheets; where they differ,
that is stated explicitly.

You can also use the full CSV export instead (Backstage → Export → CSV) — it contains the same
progress columns, plus every other project field (duration, predecessors, status, …). All three sheets
are readable by the import: every export sheet carries a first column `OPS Task ID` — a technical,
human-unreadable key the app uses to link a returned sheet back to the right task. Don't remove or
change that column; feel free to move or sort the rows, that makes no difference. Send the file to the
foreman, have them fill in the progress columns and send it back. More on the full CSV export is in the
[Import/export](docs://gids-import-export) guide.

## Where to find the feature

You can read a returned sheet back in from four places — all four open the same screen:

- Backstage → Import, the card "Update progress from a spreadsheet" at the top.
- The Planning tab, in the Progress group.
- The Table tab, in the Progress group.
- The Report tab, in the Progress group.

## Which columns are read

The import reads exactly three columns: **Completion (%)**, **Actual Start** and **Actual Finish**.
The **Start** and **Finish** columns are also read, but only to check *how* the dates in the file are
written (see below) — their values are never copied onto a task. If you change the planned dates in
the returned sheet, nothing happens: those columns are a reference point only, never input.

## Completion is always a percentage

Whatever a foreman types in the Completion (%) column is a percentage: `100` is one hundred percent
done, `1` is one percent, `45.5` may use either a comma or a period. The percent sign is optional —
`40` and `40%` mean the same thing. A value below 0 or above 100 is refused; there is no alternative
reading where, say, `0.4` would count as forty percent.

The **Excel** sheet puts the percentage in a real number cell and therefore carries the decimals
along: if a task is at 33.4%, that is what the sheet says, and you may just as well fill in decimals
yourself.

The **CSV** sheet, by contrast, always contains **whole** percentages (e.g. "38", never "38.5"). That
is not sloppiness but a necessity: a spreadsheet program with a different locale swaps the decimal and
thousands separators, so a decimal percentage in plain text gets read there as an entirely different
number (`8.38` becomes `838`). If you type decimals into a CSV yourself (for example "33.4"), that
still counts as a real change as soon as it differs from the current value. A whole percentage that
rounds to what the task already has doesn't count as a change: if a task is already at 33.4% and the
CSV sheet says "33", nothing changes. That applies at the edges too: a task at 99.5% or higher cannot
be rounded up to one hundred percent complete via "100" in a CSV — that sheet can't tell 99.5% and
100% apart, so it reads as no change. Mark such a task complete in the app itself, or fill in a real
finish date instead.

## Dates

In the **Excel** sheet dates live in real date cells. The question "is 6-9 the 6th of September or
the 9th of June?" simply doesn't arise there: the cell carries the date itself, not a way of writing
it. So if you fill in an actual date as a date, re-importing an `.xlsx` will **never** show you the
day/month question below. Type loose text into such a cell by accident and it is unreadable, and the
row is refused — the app does not guess.

The rest of this section is therefore about the **CSV** sheet. The following notations work there,
with or without a time: `2026-06-09`, `9-6-2026`, `9/6/2026`, `9.6.2026`. The app determines, for the
**whole file**, whether the first component is the day or the month — a spreadsheet program is
consistent about that, so it only needs deciding once per file. Where possible the
app works this out automatically (for example because one component is above 12, or because the dates
in the sheet match the planned dates in your project).

If the app is unsure, it **asks** you, before you see the preview: you're shown the first ambiguous
date from the file, with the two possible readings as buttons. If you pick the wrong one, you can go
back to that same question from the preview — any links you made by hand stay exactly as they were.

## An empty field means: no change

A returned sheet often comes back partially filled in. If a foreman leaves a column empty, the task's
existing value simply stays as it is — an empty field **clears nothing**. One side effect comes with
that: if you do fill in a percentage above 0 for a task that had no actual start yet, the app derives
that actual start itself — so an empty start field does not stay empty in that case.

## Linking: automatic, and by hand

Every row is first linked on `OPS Task ID`. If that's missing (for example because the sheet was
edited in another program and lost the column), the app falls back to the WBS code. A WBS fallback is
weaker evidence than the real id, so such a row shows up in the preview under "Link is uncertain": you
can **confirm** it with one click, or **change** it to a different task.

If no task can be found for a row at all — for example because the WBS code isn't unique, or because
there's nothing usable in it — it shows up under "Waiting for a link". There you link the row by hand
to a task through a searchable picker (search by WBS code or name); a task already claimed by another
row can't be picked again.

## New rows don't become new tasks

This import only updates **existing** tasks. A row that can't be linked to any task stays waiting for
a link, or gets refused — it never silently becomes a new task. To add new tasks, do that in the app
itself.

## Which rows get refused

A row is refused, with a reason shown in the preview, in cases including:

- The actual date is after the status date (hence: set that status date first).
- The task is planned to start after the status date and the row gives progress but no actual start.
  The app doesn't make that start up: fill it in in the sheet and read it in again.
- Actual finish is before actual start.
- The row refers to a summary task — those can't carry their own progress; the sheet the app exports
  says so in the cells themselves: a summary task's fill-in cells read "— summary task: do not fill
  in", and you simply leave that text alone.
- A date or percentage is unreadable.

One refused row doesn't stop the rest of the sheet: every other row is still processed.

## The preview is mandatory

Before anything in your project changes, you always see a preview first: per row, what will change (or
why a row is refused), with dates written out in full so a day/month mix-up stands out. There is no
way to skip the preview. While this screen is open, you **cannot switch to another document** — that
prevents any linking work you just did by hand from being lost to an accidental document switch.
Confirming the import happens in **one step**: a single Ctrl+Z undoes the whole sheet at once, never
row by row.

## Afterwards: recalculate

A successful import updates the progress fields on your tasks, but doesn't automatically recalculate
the schedule. Press **F5** (or the Calculate button) to let the new progress flow through the rest of
your schedule.
