# Turning on AutoSave

Goal: have the app update your project file while you work, so you do not have to keep pressing Ctrl+S.

## When you need this

You work a long session on one schedule, or you keep forgetting to save, and you want the file on disk or in a shared folder to keep up. AutoSave does not replace crash recovery: that is always on and works separately from this. What the difference is, you read in [Files and formats](docs://uitleg-bestanden).

## Steps

1. If the project has no file yet, first save it once with *Home › File › Save As*. As long as there is no file, the switch is grey and the tooltip says: *Save this project first to use AutoSave.*
2. At the top left in the bar at the top, click the *AutoSave* switch. When it is on, the tooltip says: *AutoSave is on: changes are written to this file.*
3. Keep working. As soon as your project has changes, the app writes it to your file, without a window and at most once every ten seconds. The *Unsaved* marker then disappears by itself.
4. If you want to stop, click the switch once more. The tooltip then says: *AutoSave is off. Crash recovery remains active.*

Chrome and Edge first let you only read a file that you opened. The switch does nothing there until you have saved once with *Save* (Ctrl+S) and the browser has given permission to write. After that you can turn it on. In Firefox the switch stays grey: the app cannot write into your file there.

## Pitfalls and what the app does then

**The switch belongs to one project.** Every tab has its own state. After opening a project it is always off, and the app does not remember it for a next time.

**AutoSave only writes to the file the project already has.** If you choose *Save As*, it writes to the new file from then on. The app only writes if there are changes.

**The writing can fail.** If the file has disappeared or is locked, for example, the message *Auto-save failed* appears with the reason. If the browser does not (or no longer) have permission to write, the app skips that round silently: it does not ask for it.

**The file also gets changes you would rather not keep.** AutoSave writes the state of your project as it is at that moment. If you undo something with Ctrl+Z, the file gets that undone state within ten seconds too. If you want to keep an older version, first make a copy with *Save As*.

**A crash still costs the last seconds.** The app writes at most once every ten seconds, so what you did in between is not in your file yet. Crash recovery has the same limit.

**After a recovery in the browser the switch is grey again.** A project that you get back in the browser after a crash is no longer linked to its file. Save it once, and the switch works again. See [Recovering after a crash](docs://howto-herstellen-na-een-crash).

**A project from another format has no file.** A CSV, XML, `.mpp` or `.xer` file only gets an IFC file when you save. After that you can turn on AutoSave.
