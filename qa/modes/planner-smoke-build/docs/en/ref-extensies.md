# Managing and installing extensions

Extensions add features to the app, such as extra import formats or custom ribbon buttons. They are app-level: they belong to this installation on this device, not to a project file.

## Opening

**File** → **Extensions** (Backstage). At the top sit two tabs — **Installed** and **Browse** — next to the **ZIP** and **JS** buttons, with a search field below (**Search extensions...**).

## Installed

One card per extension with name, version, category, description and author, plus:

- **On/off toggle** — enables or disables the extension without removing it.
- **Remove** — click **Confirm** once more to remove permanently.

An extension that failed to load shows an error message on its card. Without extensions the tab reports: "No extensions installed yet."

**Quarantine**

A stored extension appears under **Quarantine** when its manifest, code, assets, or internal identity is no longer valid. The app does not execute that code and shows the concrete reason on the card. A quarantine card deliberately has no on/off toggle. You can still remove it by clicking **Remove** and then **Confirm**.

The app checks an extension again immediately before you enable it. If a previously valid storage entry has since been damaged or changed, it moves to quarantine without running its code. One broken entry does not prevent other valid extensions from loading.

For older valid records, the app may supply safe missing defaults in memory. Merely opening the app does not silently rewrite such a legacy record.

## Browse (catalog)

The **Browse** tab fetches the online extension catalog (internet connection required). Each catalog entry is a card with **Install**; already-installed extensions show the **Installed** badge. If loading fails, an error message appears with **Retry**.

An invalid catalog entry is skipped while later valid entries remain available. The app shows the number of skipped entries and writes their technical reasons to the debug log. If the catalog as a whole is invalid, loading does fail.

## Installing from a file

- **ZIP** — installs an extension ZIP (with `manifest.json` + `main.js`).
- **JS** — installs a single `.js` file with an embedded manifest.

After installation the extension is enabled immediately and any ribbon buttons appear right away.

The app validates manifests, identity, ZIP paths, and any checksums before installation, and validates stored data again before execution. This is not a JavaScript sandbox: valid extension code runs in the same environment as the app. The consent prompt therefore remains a trust decision. Install only code and authors you trust.

## Importing through extensions

**File** → **Import** lists the import formats offered by installed extensions; click a format and pick a file. Without import extensions the page reports: "No import extensions installed. Add one via Extensions." The built-in import formats (CSV, MS Project, P6) are separate from this — see [Import/export](docs://gids-import-export).

## Writing your own extensions

The guide for extension authors (manifest, API, permissions) lives in the repository: `docs/extensions.md`, file `docs/extensions.md`.
