# Reports & printing

A schedule isn't finished until you can share it — on paper for a site meeting, as an image in a
presentation, or as an overview of what's coming up and what has already shifted. That's what the
**Report** tab is for, with eleven report types and a print preview.

## What you'll learn here

- The report types on the **Report** tab: the Gantt print, the resource diagram ("who does what,
  and when" — one sheet per person if you like), two table reports on milestones and variance, and
  seven table reports for the weekly site meeting, progress reporting, the schedule review,
  resources and management.
- How the print preview works: paper size, orientation and which elements you toggle on/off.
- How to actually print a report or save it as a file.
- What **Ctrl+P** does in this app.

## Getting to the report screen

There are three ways in to the same screen: click the **Report** ribbon tab, go to
**Backstage → Print** (which opens the report screen directly), or press **Ctrl+P**. All three land
on the same place — there's no separate "print" dialog; the report screen *is* the print preview.

The screen is split into two columns: a settings panel on the left with the **Report type** picker
at the top, and a live preview on the right that updates immediately as you change the settings on
the left.

## The report types

### Gantt print

A full, formatted printout of the Gantt bars — this is the only report type with a settings block:

- **Paper**: A4, A3, A2 or A1.
- **Orientation**: landscape or portrait.
- **Auto-fit to paper** (on = the time axis is automatically compressed to the chosen size) or a
  manual **zoom** slider if you turn auto-fit off. Even for a multi-year schedule, the activity
  table and report text remain the same physical size on A4, A3, A2 and A1; only the time axis becomes
  denser or wider.
- **Font size** — 90, 100, 110 or 125%; scales the report text, row height and header/footer,
  independently of the zoom level above.
- **Repeat header on each page** — on by default; keeps the report header visible on every printed
  page instead of only the first.
- **Repeat footer on each page** — on by default; puts the footer with project name, print date and
  legend at the bottom of every page instead of only the last, so a sheet handed out on its own
  carries its own legend — also when the timeline is spread over several pages side by side. If
  the whole print fits on one page, the footer simply stays below the last row. The strip costs
  space on every page: roughly two rows fewer per sheet, so occasionally one page more, and a
  resource that just fitted on one sheet with *Each resource on a new page* can spill onto two.
  Off = the footer on the last page only. The page number ("3 / 7") always sits in the bottom
  margin, separate from the footer; the footer itself no longer carries a page number.
- **Timeline over** — spreads the Gantt timeline across 1 to 8 pages side by side; only available
  with auto-fit on. Choose more pages when you want a less compressed timeline without reducing
  the table text.
- Toggles for **task names on bars**, **show completion**, **critical path**, **show float**,
  **dependencies**, **weekends** and **legend**. With **show completion** off the whole *Compl.*
  column disappears from the task table and the timeline gets that space; the table starts at the
  WBS column, there is no separate row-number column.
- **Truncate task names** — on (default): the name column has a fixed width that you set with the
  **Name column** slider, and a longer name ends in an ellipsis. Off: the column becomes exactly as
  wide as the longest name in the report (indentation included), so nothing is cut off; the
  timeline gets correspondingly narrower. Only an extremely long name is still truncated, so that a
  single name can never claim the whole page.
- The remaining table columns — *WBS*, *Duration*, *Start*, *End*, *Compl.* and, in the resource
  diagram, *Units/d* and *Curve* — need no setting: each one becomes exactly as wide as its header
  and its widest cell in this report. A long translated header therefore gets the room it needs
  instead of running into the next column, and short content (one-level WBS codes, single-digit
  durations) hands the leftover millimetres to the timeline. Only an exceptionally wide value stops
  at the column maximum; that cell then ends in an ellipsis.
- **Bar colors** — one choice shared by the on-screen Gantt and the report. *Critical path* gives
  the familiar red/orange/blue; *Per task — automatic* gives every task a stable palette color;
  *By category* lets you select a field from the same list as **Group**. For example, choose
  **Task type** to give construction, installation and demolition one color each, or the
  **Discipline** activity code to color each discipline. WBS, custom fields and **Resource** are
  available too. With Resource, a task assigned to multiple parties gets a segmented bar weighted
  by their assignment. Tasks without a value use neutral gray. Outside *Critical path*, a **red
  outline** keeps critical tasks recognizable and the legend lists only values visible in the
  report. Change the choice under **View** and it updates here immediately — and vice versa. If a
  previously selected project field is absent from the current project, the app temporarily uses
  Task type without forgetting your selection.
- **Status line** — *None* (default), *Status date line* (a vertical dashed line at the project's
  status date) or *Progress line* (the same zigzag line as on screen: per task a bulge toward the
  progress position). Without a status date in the project nothing is drawn — set one first via
  **Planning** → **Baselines & progress** → **Status date**; the panel points this out.
- **Follow view** — when on, the export prints exactly what you see on screen: the active filter,
  grouping, sorting and collapsed groups stay collapsed. Off (default), the export prints the full
  task tree.
- A **company** field (auto-fills from the project setting, but is separately editable here) and the
  **author** (read-only, from the project info).

Relationship lines in the report use the same visual language as the Gantt view: a **solid** line is
a driving relationship, a **dashed** line a non-driving one, and a driving relationship between two
critical tasks is **red**. Turn *critical path* off and those lines go neutral and the legend entry
disappears; the bar colour itself follows the **Bar colors** choice. The legend at the bottom
summarises the difference. Before the first calculation every line is drawn neutral and
solid — press *Calculate* (F5) first.

The summary block above it shows the live count of tasks, leaf tasks, critical tasks and relations
in the project. The settings panel remembers your choices between sessions — reopen the Report tab
later and paper size, toggles, font size and the rest come back exactly as you left them. Only the
company field resets: it always starts from the project's own setting, so a report never carries
over another project's company name.

### Resource diagram

The same Gantt print, but grouped **per resource**: every crew, person or machine gets its own band
with the tasks assigned to it underneath, in order of start. That is the "who does what, and when"
overview for the site meeting, or — with the option **Each resource on a new page** — a separate
sheet per person to hand out. A task with two resources appears under both bands; summary tasks are
left out — an assignment on a summary task (which an import can produce) is not shown here. **Include tasks without a resource** adds a *(none)* band
at the bottom, so the meeting can see at a glance what nobody owns yet. **Group by resource type**
adds a layer above: first a band per type — labour, crew, subcontractor, equipment, material, in
that fixed order — with the resources inside it; useful when a meeting discusses the people first
and the equipment after, or when you only want to print the equipment block; the number after a type
band counts the task rows below it, so a task under two resources of the same type counts twice.
With *Each resource on a new page* a type band starts a new sheet together with its first resource. **Reporting period** —
the same control as on the table reports, see further down — limits the diagram to a time window:
only tasks that touch the window take part, the time axis runs exactly from the start to the end
date, and a bar that continues beyond it is cut off at the edge. That lets a meeting put the
look-ahead report and the resource diagram side by side over exactly the same weeks. *Project
duration* (the default) is the usual behaviour; with a window the summary block also counts how
many tasks fall outside it. After the task name two columns **Units/d** and **Curve** are shown by
default: how many units per day the band's resource is assigned to the task, and with which
distribution curve — "you are on Foundations half days, front loaded" says more than "you are on
Foundations". A task under two bands shows each band's own load; two assignments of the same
resource on one task are added up, and a dash in the curve column means those assignments carry
different curves. If the assignment has its own hour distribution the column says *Contour*; if
the curve was imported from MS Project or P6 and is none of the eight built-in shapes it says
*Imported curve* — the same as in the properties panel. The two columns make the table up to a good 130 px
wider (the curve column is as wide as the longest curve name in the report) and the time axis
narrower. If less than about a fifth of the paper width would remain for
the timeline — because of a wide name column, a large font size (the table scales with it, the
timeline does not) or small or portrait paper — the report drops the two columns itself and says so
in the summary block. On portrait A4 with the default settings they fit. A larger paper size or
landscape, a smaller font size or a narrower table (a narrower name column with *Truncate task
names*, or *Show completion* off) gives the timeline more room; as soon as the table leaves enough
room again the columns come back by themselves. Turn **Show units/day and curve** off for the narrow
table of the Gantt print.

The settings of the Gantt print apply here too — critical path, float, bar colours, status line,
paper, header repeat — with three exceptions: *Follow view* (this report doesn't take its rows from
the screen), *Dependencies* (a task can sit under several bands, and with one sheet per resource arrows
would run off the sheet; so this report draws none) and *Critical path* (that toggle only colours
relationship lines, and there are none here — the bars simply follow the **Bar colors** choice, and
the legend explains them). So there's no need to group the Gantt view by
resource yourself first. Bands are per resource, not per name: two resources that happen to share a
name each get their own band (*Jan #1*, *Jan #2*), and a resource without a name gets a sequence
number. The summary block counts the resources, the assignments and the tasks without a resource —
that last count includes milestones and hammocks, because they are drawn here (the *Resource
assignments* table report counts real activities only). With *Repeat footer on each page* (on by
default) every sheet you hand out carries its own legend. If there are no assignments yet, the preview
says so instead of showing an empty page; assigning happens on the **Resources** tab (see
[Resources & histogram](docs://gids-resources-histogram)).

### Milestone overview

A table of every milestone in the project: WBS, name, kind (automatic/start/finish), date, the
underlying constraint or deadline, float, whether the milestone is mandatory, and status (on
schedule / critical / late). The summary block shows the total milestone count, how many are
mandatory and how many are late. This report has no paper size/orientation settings — it prints the
table exactly as shown.

### Variance

Compares the current schedule against the active baseline: baseline start/finish versus current
start/finish, the difference in working days for start and finish, and a status per task (on
schedule / late / early / new / dropped). If there's no active baseline, the screen states that
explicitly instead of showing an empty report. The summary block also shows the shift in the
project's finish date in working days, if there is one. See the guide
[Baselines & progress](docs://gids-baselines-voortgang) for how to record a baseline before this
report can tell you anything useful.

## The seven table reports

The remaining report types are table reports drawn straight from the last calculation. They share
a few conventions:

- Only **leaf tasks** count as activities; summary tasks appear only in the WBS summary. Hammock
  (LOE) tasks are left out of the activity reports, but included in the two resource reports:
  supervision books effort too, and it is the same set as the histogram.
- The **reference day** is the project's status date. Without a status date the report uses today
  and says so. Set a status date first via **Planning** → **Baselines & progress** →
  **Status date** if you want a report for a fixed reporting date.
- Dates and float come from the last **calculation**. If the schedule changed since you last
  pressed *Calculate* (F5), a note appears above the report; the PDF export always recalculates
  first.
- Every report has a small **Report options** block under the summary, starting with the paper
  size and orientation of the PDF (a wide table on A4 portrait gets very small; pick A3 landscape
  instead); those choices are remembered between sessions. Working days are abbreviated to *wd*.
- A task can appear in several sections of one report when those sections each answer a different
  question (in progress and critical, for instance).

### Reporting period

Four reports work on a time window: look-ahead, progress, resource loading and resource
assignments. They share one *Reporting period* control in the report options, with its own
remembered setting per report (the resource diagram above offers the same control):

- **Next / last week, 2, 4, 6, 8 or 12 weeks** and **next / last month** — counted from the
  project's status date (or today if none is set). A preset is inclusive on both ends: *next 4
  weeks* on Thursday 10 September runs through Wednesday 7 October. Change the status date and the
  window moves with it. Without a status date a preset counts from today, and "today" is determined
  again every time the panel renders — on the UTC calendar, not the local clock: in Amsterdam the day
  turns over at 01:00 (winter time) or 02:00 (summer time), in New York at 19:00 or 20:00 the evening
  before. Leave the app open overnight and the window shifts by a day after that moment.
- **Project duration** — from the earliest start to the latest finish in the schedule.
- **Custom** — two dates of your own. The *From* and *To* fields become editable (type or use the
  date picker); with a preset they show the calculated dates read-only. An end date before the
  start date, or an empty date field, is highlighted in red and not applied. Pick a preset again and the preset dates
  replace your custom range.

The chosen period appears as the subtitle of the report and of the PDF; the progress report shows
it in its summary.

### Look-ahead

The list for the weekly site meeting: every activity in the reporting period (the next month by
default) — what starts, what continues, what finishes — plus what should already have
happened. Each row shows WBS, name, start and finish, remaining duration, completion, total float,
whether the task is critical or near-critical, the assigned resources and a status: **Starting**
(begins in the window), **In progress**, **Should have started** (start before the reference day,
not yet begun) or **Overdue** (finish before the reference day, not yet done). A task that spans
the whole window is included too — the same overlap idea as the *In progress* filter field in the
Gantt.

### Critical & near-critical

Which activities drive the project finish, and which are about to. Critical comes from the
calculation; *near-critical* is a total float from 0 up to the threshold in the report options
(5 working days by default), or the marking from the scheduling options if you have set one.
Completed tasks are excluded. Sorted by float path (when the scheduling options compute float
paths), then by float, then by start. The columns also show free float and the path number.

### Progress report

The periodic "where do we stand" overview at the status date. The summary gives the baseline and
forecast finish with the difference in working days, **planned** versus **actual** progress and
the counts per state. Both percentages are duration-weighted over the leaf tasks: a milestone
weighs nothing, a month of work weighs a lot. Planned is measured on the dates of the active
baseline (the agreement you measure against); without a baseline on the current schedule, and the
report says so. Below that, five sections: completed in the reporting period, in progress, starting in
the next period, overdue, and the open critical activities. The reporting period (the last
month by default) decides what counts as *completed in the period*; the *starting in the next
period* section looks ahead from the status date — to the end of the period when it lies (partly)
after the status date; for a *last …* preset as far ahead as the period looks back; for a custom or
project period that lies entirely in the past the section stays empty. The summary shows both
bounds.

### Schedule health

An automated schedule review in the spirit of the DCMA 14-point assessment. Every check gets a
severity and a count, with the findings per task or relation underneath:

- **Errors** — negative float, missed deadline, violated constraint, inconsistent progress (actual
  start or finish after the status date, 100% without an actual finish, or the reverse).
- **Warnings** — open start or end (no predecessor or successor; milestones excepted), long
  duration, leads (negative lag), hard constraints (MSO/MFO/SNLT/FNLT or a mandatory pin),
  out-of-sequence progress.
- **Information** — near-critical, high float and long lags.

The thresholds are in the report options. By default they follow DCMA: high float and long
duration above 44 working days; a lag above 10 working days. A clean schedule has zero errors;
warnings and information are a reason to look, not necessarily to change.

### Resource loading

Per resource and per week or month the required effort against the available capacity (in
unit-days), the difference, the peak load on a single day and whether the period is overloaded. It
is the same calculation as the histogram on the **Resources** tab, but as a table to lay side by
side in a staffing meeting. Rows are grouped per resource — name and type appear on the first row
of each group only, just like the resource assignments report. Use *Aggregation* to choose between
calendar weeks and calendar months; the reporting period decides which weeks or months are
included (every week or month that touches the period, as a whole — so always the same number as
the histogram). Only periods with demand are listed; with *Overloaded periods only* you keep just
the bottlenecks. When a page break in the PDF falls inside a group, the resource name is not
repeated on the next page.

### Resource assignments

Per resource which activities it is assigned to: WBS, name, start and finish, remaining duration,
units per day, completion, critical and status. Completed tasks are excluded by default. With a
reporting period (the whole project by default) it becomes the *resource look-ahead*: only what
this crew or piece of equipment has to do in that period, plus what is still open. The summary also counts the tasks without a
resource.

### WBS summary

The schedule rolled up per WBS element down to a selectable level — the management overview. Per
element: start and finish, baseline start and finish, duration, duration-weighted progress, the
finish difference against the baseline, the smallest total float and the number of activities, of
which critical, in progress and completed. Pick a level (2 by default) or the full WBS, and
optionally the activities themselves under their element.

## Printing and exporting

There is no separate print button with a system dialog: printing goes through the PDF. Export the
report, open the PDF and print it — that way paper shows exactly what the preview shows, with the
same page breaks (never through a row).

Column headers always appear in full in the PDF: if a translated header does not fit the width the
column was designed for, the column grows instead of truncating the header — just like the table on
screen. Cell content that is too long (a long task name, a row of resources) does end in an
ellipsis; that is the intended division of space.

Every report type has an **Export PDF** button. For the Gantt report it saves the current preview
as an actual PDF file (filename ending in `-planning.pdf`) — one page sized to the physical
dimensions of the chosen paper size and orientation; the table reports export their table with the
same paper settings. The PDF file is **vector-based**: bars, lines and text
are stored as PDF drawing instructions rather than a single embedded image, so it stays crisp at
any zoom level and the text is selectable and searchable in any PDF viewer. This applies to Latin,
Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic and Persian text — Arabic and Persian are shaped and embedded as vector text
as well. Chinese, Japanese and Korean text is opt-in: install a font extension that supplies those
glyphs and it is embedded as vector too (selectable and searchable); without such an extension that
text is exported as a raster image — still correctly displayed, but not selectable or searchable. Handy for email or archiving without going through the system
print dialog. If you want a different paper size than the one configured above, pick it in the
report itself before exporting — the PDF is always at the physical size of the chosen paper.

## Reports in practice

Each report type serves a different conversation:

- The **Gantt report** is the classic site-meeting handout: the critical path highlighted, float
  visible on the non-critical bars, and the legend explaining what each colour means. Turn on
  **task names on bars** and **show completion** if the audience doesn't already know the schedule;
  turn them off for a clean overview on A1 if a separate task list is handed out alongside it.
- The **milestone overview** is for anyone who only wants the important dates without paging through
  dozens of task rows — for example a client who mainly wants to know whether the mandatory handover
  dates are being met. The ◆ symbol before a milestone name in the table marks a **mandatory**
  milestone.
- The **variance report** is the conversation about correcting course: which tasks are slipping
  relative to the baseline, and by how many working days. See this report in practice in the showcase
  [Nieuwbouw Appartementencomplex De Vaart](examples://showcase-appartementencomplex.ifc), which has
  two baselines (a contract baseline and a rebaseline after a change order) with their own progress
  and status date — a good example of how the Δ columns fill in once there's an actual difference
  between the baseline and the current schedule.

- The **look-ahead** is the list for the weekly meeting; the **progress report** the periodic
  report to the client or the board. Combine them: the progress report says where you stand, the
  look-ahead what has to happen now.
- **Schedule health** belongs to a schedule review before you record a baseline or attach a
  schedule to a contract: zero errors is the bar.
- The **resource diagram** is the hand-out "who does what" sheet; the two **resource** tables and
  the **WBS summary** serve the staffing meeting and the management overview respectively. All seven table reports also work on the showcase above, which
  has a status date, baselines and progress.

The live preview on the right refreshes on every change to the settings on the left — there's no
separate "refresh" button, and nothing is computed only at print time.

- A variance report has nothing to compare until a baseline has been recorded — read the guide
  [Baselines & progress](docs://gids-baselines-voortgang).
- The critical path and float shown on the Gantt report come from the same calculation as the Gantt
  view itself — read the guide [Critical path & advanced analysis](docs://gids-kritiek-pad-analyse)
  for how to read that.
