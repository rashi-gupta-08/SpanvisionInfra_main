# Known Alpha Limitations

Pile Plane Workspace is an early testing release. The following limitations are
intentional and should be considered when evaluating its results.

## Engineering Status

- The software and its output have not completed formal engineering validation
  or certification.
- Every pile plan and calculated option must be checked by a qualified
  professional before use in design, procurement, or construction.
- The CPT-selection rules are configurable approximations. Project-specific
  engineering judgement remains necessary.

## Optimization

- The optimizer minimizes cost within configuration limits and can optionally
  reduce neighbor differences within a cost budget. Larger runs may finish
  without proving optimality, and browser and desktop runtimes can differ.
  Quick improve uses local moves and does not prove a global optimum.
- It does not replace manual review of practical pile zones, constructability,
  or local variation.
- The preferred utilization range controls viewer highlighting. Engineering
  option validity remains based on the calculated resistance check. The
  optimizer has a configurable maximum utilization.
- Load-point grouping combines the automatic distance rule with undoable manual
  group and separation overrides. Manual groups must remain connected in the
  project's Gabriel graph; arbitrary disconnected location sets are rejected.

## Data and Projects

- IFCPP is an evolving alpha project format. Later alpha releases may require
  migrations.
- One IFCPP project can contain multiple pile plans. CPT selections and legend
  appearance mappings remain shared project settings, while active pile sizes
  and pile-tip levels are stored separately for each pile plan.
- Import currently supports CSV and XLSX sources for load points, CPTs, and
  foundation advice.
- RFEM load-point import recognises supported coordinate and reaction headers
  and falls back to the first two worksheets for traditional RFEM exports. The
  profile joins coordinates and reactions by node number.
- RFEM design loads currently use the minimum PZ envelope value, supporting the
  `Min PZ'`, `Min PZ`, and `Min` row variants. Selecting another force component
  or result rule is not yet supported.
- Empty foundation-advice values are imported as missing data and produce
  warnings.
- CPTs without coordinates are ignored when reconciling foundation advice.
- CPTs with coordinates but no capacities remain available and can cause pile
  options to have status Missing.
- Standard pile-plan tables can update pile assignments and manual CPT
  selections. Legacy `Vergrendeld.xlsx` tables contain pile assignments only;
  rows representing more than one pile are skipped with a warning.
- Pile-plan import matches a validated ID first and then falls back to one
  unique coordinate match within the configured tolerance (1 mm by default).
- Historical Legacy rows are ignored when a more reliable current ID match is
  available. Conflicting equally reliable rows remain skipped with warnings.
- Individual project sources can be refreshed while matched pile assignments
  and manual CPT selections are retained. Load points use a validated ID and
  position match, followed by a unique coordinate fallback. CPTs keep their
  identity by ID even when their position changes; renamed CPTs use the unique
  coordinate fallback.
- When CPT IDs are removed and cannot be matched by position, their existing
  foundation advice is removed as well. Refresh the corresponding foundation
  advice when adding new CPTs or changing the capacity data.

## Platforms and Deferred Features

- The hosted browser demo and Windows x64 desktop package are the supported alpha
  distributions.
- macOS and Linux packages are not provided for this release.
- Browser projects store imported source information, but are not refresh-linked
  to the original files on the user's computer.
