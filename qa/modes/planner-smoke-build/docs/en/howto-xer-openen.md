# Opening a Primavera P6 file (.xer)

Goal: open a schedule from Primavera P6 directly in the app, without exporting it to XML first.

## When you need this

A client or main contractor works in Primavera and delivers their schedule as an `.xer` file. You want to view it, calculate it or add to it. The app only reads `.xer` files: it does not write `.xer` and never changes your file. From the file it takes the WBS structure and the activities with duration, dates, constraints and progress, the relations with lag, the calendars and the resources with their assignments, plus activity codes, custom fields (UDFs), notes and P6's scheduling settings. An activity of the type *Level of Effort* becomes a hammock.

## Steps

1. Choose *Home › File › Open* or press Ctrl+O. Choose the `.xer` file.
2. The app opens one tab for each project that has tasks. The project with the most tasks is the active tab. A tab is called *Project name (Project ID)* if the P6 project ID differs from the name.
3. Read the message at the bottom. For a file with three projects it can look like this: *XER file opened: 3 project documents.* Below it are lines that explain what the app did. See the heading below.
4. Check whether there is a bar under the ribbon: *You're viewing the schedule as Primavera recorded it; recalculating would shift 1 task.* Primavera records its own calculated dates in the file. If the app's calculation differs from them, the app shows Primavera's dates as long as you change nothing. What that means and how you switch to the app's own calculation is in [Dates as recorded](docs://uitleg-datums-zoals-opgeslagen). The message *This file contains hour-based planning.* can also appear, with the button *Enable hour planning*. See [Turning on hour planning](docs://howto-urenplanning-aanzetten).
5. Save your project with Ctrl+S. Because an `.xer` is never overwritten, the app asks where the new IFC file should go. It suggests *Project name (Project ID)* as the file name.

### The lines below the message

The first line of the message names the number of opened tabs. Below it are only the lines that apply. These deserve your attention:

- *This project calculates as Primavera P6. Change it via File → Project info → Calculation profile and options.* The app calculates this project with Primavera's calculation rules. With *Open calculation profile* you go to the setting.
- *1 baseline project excluded.* and *1 baseline materialized.* If a project in P6 designates another project as its baseline, that other project does not open as a tab of its own. It becomes the active baseline of the project that refers to it.
- *A protective baseline fallback was used.* If designating baselines would mean that no project opens at all, if a project refers to itself or if projects refer to each other in a loop, the app simply opens all projects and makes no baselines.
- *1 external link preserved.* A relation between two projects. The app keeps it as source data, but does not turn it into a relation in your schedule.
- *1 task shows the dates as Primavera recorded them (not recalculated).* The number of tasks you see in the view *Dates as recorded*.

The other lines are diagnostics of the reading itself: the number of projects found, a skipped empty project, an ignored dangling baseline reference, a text encoding other than plain UTF-8 and counters for findings in the tables, the calendars and the numbers, for unknown field values and for P6 scheduling settings that the app replaced by a safe choice. They ask nothing of you. *Read more* opens the Help about opening Primavera files.

## Pitfalls and what the app does then

**Not everything becomes a tab or a relation.** A project without activities does not open, a baseline project does not open as a tab of its own and a relation between two projects does not become a relation in your schedule. The app reports that in the lines below the message.

**Every tab is a project of its own.** If you save one, the IFC file keeps the complete original `.xer` along. If you reopen that IFC file later, the app still knows Primavera's dates. If that source archive is damaged, or another IFC program rewrote the file, the app reports: *The XER source archive in this file is unusable and was left out; the project itself opened in full.* The schedule, the calculation profile and all project data are complete. What is missing: the dates as Primavera stored them and the source provenance for AI and extensions. Open the original `.xer` again to get the archive back.

**An export to CSV, MS Project XML or P6 XML loses data.** The app warns: *Exporting to CSV loses XER source information.* IFC loses nothing.

**A file the app cannot read.** You get an error message, with the reason. A few examples:

- *This is not a valid or supported XER file.*
- *An XER table is missing required columns.*
- *The P6 project in this XER file contains no activities.*

Nothing opens then. Check the file in P6, or ask the sender for a new export.
