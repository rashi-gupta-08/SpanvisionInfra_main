"""
Pydantic data models for IDS validation results.

This module contains the data structures for capturing IDS validation outcomes
at multiple levels: overall validation, per-specification, per-requirement,
and per-element. These models enable structured JSON serialization for
downstream features including UI display, report generation, and BCF export.
