"""
Project API router — persistent project and file management.

Endpoints for CRUD on projects, and upload/download/delete of
IFC, BCF, and IDS files within projects. Files are stored on disk
under PROJECT_FILES_DIR/{project_id}/{file_type}/.

Also provides .wefc envelope endpoints that bridge the persistent
project (DB row) to its corresponding tenant Nextcloud folder.
